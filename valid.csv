Getting people to join events is very hard. Life is beautiful when you see people interacting with each other and not glued to the screen, which can have an impact on mental health. Real communications weighs greater importance than virtual communication. Facebook gives a license for people to turn nasty toward people they do not know. Do not depend on facebook for everything .Take breaks from it and do not use it excessively. I agree facebook is part of our culture. I do not like seeing people posting all the time on it.

84,Facebook,2022-05-19T19:23:03.000Z,3,"I am not setting Facebook down because as far as I am concern,  what you get free as a consumer you can take or leave.   So I give them still a medium critic. However, I hope someone from the company is overlooking critics and perhaps it will help to solve some of the now arriving  problems. Since Facebook has taken over other social media the advertising appears to be getting out of hand.  OK,  again, if you get something for free, someone has to pay for it.  In cases like Facebook and a few other social media the free page is produced through advertising.  Here is what is critical if it comes to advertising that actually is ruining the freedom of my so called profile wall.  When I   go shopping I don't have to enter stores I don't want.  If I get commercial at home, I can shut them down.  Facebook  has an option to remove the advertising you don't like.  But for every removal, Facebook will give you 2 fresh once  back to clutter my news feed.  Before, I was  able to choose my own subjects.  Now, they just put them in my news feed even if I  have just turned one of the same type off.   Facebook, please return to your old ways and let us choose what we like to see.  Don't push garbage and spam on your members.  Privacy law in groups or on your profile gets violated by Facebook more than enough right now.  Yes, Facebook violates our rights  to freedom of speech. (clean speech)  I host a few genealogy groups and lately,  when ever I post something that includes War, American Soldiers and historical facts,  Facebook removes it with the announcement of violation of the Facebook standart.   I had to  go after them in a few cases,  because I am very careful what I post and I don't post against their standard because I post with common sense.     Facebook, it is time to learn your history before you act out of control. Last thing on my critic list is the fact that I get posts from friends that use   pre-written posters from people or  companies that should not be able to post at all.   I grew up in a home without foul language.   Or as we called it ""Street language.""  I feel that everybody can do what they want to do.  However, when I open up my facebook in the morning and find already posters with a head line that goes deep into street language,  I feel that I don't even want to be on Facebook anymore.  if I don't want to see it I need to turn it off and in many ways I am not sure why people are allowed to post this in the first place since many Post have the type of language that is supposed to be against Facebook's policy. The title often alone is in violation of Facebook's standard,  but people still post it because they think some of the stuff is cool.  I have to admit,  that not everything is what the title says.   But often the title comes across as disrespect toward your friends.  Here, censorship of speech should be used.  Facebook, watch what you let into your door with ready made posters.   I would not be a Facebook user anymore if I wouldn't have committed myself to help others with their genealogy and  to keep in contact with family members.   However, I keep my promises even if I feel offended almost every day.  It is getting  harder to be helpful with so much uncensored filth that is coming up on Facebook now.
