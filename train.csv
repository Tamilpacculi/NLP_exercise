12,Facebook,2021-08-16T21:37:49.000Z,1,"I signed up for Facebook on the weekend purely to sell my possessions in Marketplace. I upload my face photo, name, DoB and 6 adverts for Lego I have for sale.

I click on the ""appeal"" option and uploaded a photo of me as per instructions. Two days later I see if my account is open only to find it is disabled permanently.  I did not use any offensive images or words, I did not contact anyone - except click a link to join my local marketplace groups.  Fb does not give any option to contact them, to find out why I am disabled or what I need to do in order to have my account re-activated.

49,Facebook,2022-05-07T20:01:02.000Z,1,"Like many others here, my Instagram account (that’s linked to my Facebook account) has been disabled for absolutely no reason but “Meta” claimed that it’s because I violated their terms which I did no such thing. I woke up one day and got a popup asking me to verify my phone number, so I did and enter a code they sent me then BAM, my account was locked out and they told me to wait 24 hours.First, let me start by saying I NEVER had issues with Facebook or Instagram. They’re collecting data and learning from me as a cost for me using their platform and I’ve accept that. I accepted their changes, their consistent pushy ads, their bugs, glitches, and everything else. But this is going TOO FAR. I’ve read on so many places online, app reviews, Reddit posts where many people have also gotten their Instagram or Facebook account suspended for no reason.Keep in mind, I’m a very average user who shares my creative content (nothing with violence, nudity, or anything offensive). I’m the most average Instagram user that uses the platform to keep up with artists, following many awesome pages and to have group conversations with friends and family.Secondly, this is atrociously irresponsible of Meta/IG/FB to suspend accounts just because they programmed some bot that mistakenly flags people for innocent things or for no reason at all (in my case). They disable accounts instantly with no warning but yet with all the data they collected, all the money they make from ad spend, marketing and transactions, they can’t have at least ONE call center with humans to look through these cases and reactivate accounts which takes probably a click of a button?!?!! They literally don’t care about their user-base or community whether you pay them or not hence why customer support is a foreign concept to them!Thirdly, I’ve tried submitting numerous forms for weeks. I’ve submitted humiliating photos of myself holding up a handwritten sign per their instructions at least 7 times and submitted my ID to them 3 times only to be ignored over and over again.I’m flipping infuriated right now and I’ve heard this happen to people in the past. I never thought it would happen to me but since it happened, I’ve been nothing but angry. I feel like a portion of my social life has been robbed from me. Many people reading this might think that’s over exaggeration but I’m in my early 30s, I’m introverted and I have a lot of mental burden I’m dealing with. Sharing and posting on IG and connecting with other artists around the world was my way to cope. I’ve lost it all in a blink of an eye! I cannot create a new account because I don't have a separate phone number or email that i could use since my contact details are still connected to the disabled account. Also, making a new account and trying to regain all my data from the past 12 years manually is just too much work!FYI: There's scammers and spammers everywhere on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media with people claiming they could hack and get your account back. These jerks are spamming this everywhere, trying to mislead people into thinking they can retrieve accounts. Then, there's others who ""know people at IG"" and try to charge thousands for getting accounts reactivated for you. IG claims they don't allow this but if they can't even help us, why would they care about their employees extorting users?! I cannot believe this has been an on-going problem for so long and IG just brushed it away. How do we know these people who work at IG aren't the ones disabling accounts and then extorting users to pay for it back?!",0

FB suspend me because either a scam artist or FB user from India try to scam me or rip me off so in turn I send them pictures of a huge black dick the size of my arm and Facebook suspended me. Could possibly be my add sharing my opinion that Canada is ruined because the government has let in millions too many immigrants not sure but if a website condones queers and transvestite stay away farrrr away from these twisted sickos. It goes against mother nature and I worry the younger generations are going to be brainwashed with chicks with penis and men on men. My goooddd ewwww,0
75,Facebook,2022-07-11T00:45:10.000Z,1,I find Facebook extremely one sided.  If a comment on a site (for example Sky News) does not suit their agenda they ban you for the silliest comment and sometimes a very factual comment.  There are so many important issues in the world yet facebook are acting just the same as a communist nation would act.  Do as I say or we will ban you.  To have such a violent and immediate reaction to a comment I made stating if Joe Biden is returned to office then I will know that Americans do not understand how economics work and that they are stupid.   Voting for an ill man is insane.  If facebook disagrees with your leanings then you are banned.  Does this give rise to the rumours that facebook donates millions of dollars to the Democrat campaign. Is this the real reason I was banned for 24 hours?,0

Although the issue I have with Facebook is that the site has banned myself for stating ""Shoot em"". This is the only statement in the post and they say it is a violation of their policy. The odd thing is that not only do they have videos called ""Shoot em up"", but there is a actual profile titled ""Shoot em"". Facebook has now violated a law. I guess we will have to see how the civil law looks upon discrimination and other violations of the law. Anyone else that has had similar issues please post here and hopefully we can all end this recklessness of oppression.",0

Where were those community  standards when a cop hater posted my address last year because her little feelings were hurt when I put her in her place??? So it's okay for the left to bully the right and nothing is ever done about it, but when the right has the audacity to say the current ""president "" needs to be impeached, im banned for 7 days.

STRIPE will not release any funds to new customers until you can prove via Facebook, with a tracking number, that you have posted the item your selling. Once you do this STRIPE will process the payment, but being a new customer it takes 10 days. So STRIPE sits on the funds for 10 days and possibly more so you would of thought they would have picked up the fact that the account or card used was fraudulent…. Apparently not… and Facebook aren’t interested either.

This was NOT me.The person who has hacked my Facebook has used my PayPal and made a payment of £125 from my account to META on Facebook for ads!!!! I can't contact anyone from Facebook or Instagram to help get my accounts back. I upload my ID online and Facebook comes back saying they have no reviewers to review my ID or account at the moment due to coronavirus!!I can now not access my accounts even after uploading my driving license as ID and mobile number.I had two step verification set up and had been texted the code but it seems the hacker had removed my mobile number and email address.Please can someone point me in the right direction to help me get access back to my Instagram and Facebook. I have never had any issue before and have had my account for well over 10 years or more I will be very upset to loose it.My messenger has also logged me out, I just managed to change my password via the computer for this and still doesn't work.I will attach all screenshots, ID and evidence if needed.",0

The price advertised is nothing like the true price once you read the advert.Facebook is allowing this to happen with no checks on them.There are so many, none of the genuine private ads for sale can get through. You open marketplace up and all you see is bed after bed after bed, but they are mostly these scam sales and the people with genuine items for sale are getting pushed out.Surely it is about time Facebook stopped these scams or at least have a section for private sales and a separate section for the traders and scammers",0

I recently fell victim to a hack on my account, despite taking all of the necessary precautions such as using a strong and unique password and enabling two-factor authentication. To make matters worse, the hacker accessed my account from the other side of the world and Facebook did not took action. Despite this, Facebook failed to adequately protect my data and was no help in resolving the issue. To add insult to injury, I was lucky to have removed Facebook from my PayPal approved automatic payments just before the hack, otherwise, I would have suffered a significant financial loss.Not only does Facebook fail to provide adequate security, but their customer service is non-existent. When my account was compromised, they locked me out without any action on my part and didn't contact me back. I have to wait until 59 days knowing the hacker is still in the business/ad asset.All Facebook seems to care about is collecting money through advertising and selling private data, they even have the audacity to ask you to raise money for charity on your own birthday but when it comes to providing a basic service to ensure the security of your data, they fall short.",0

There is no way i have searched to work to gain back access to my account. You as a company have been told of my situation and obviously not just me but i do not know how many have been hacked.

However Zoo Book likes to whip the negativity in the comments section to the point where the animal's (users) , rattle the cage and then the mods get out their stick and ban   a lot of comments that don't fit their main priority. Greed vested interest. Like most platforms they whip up a toxic level of hatful reactions and then either shadow ban the entire section  or manipulate time lines to suit the elites. Always click on show all comments to get a better picture of public  sentiment.  Silly comments are allowed , untruthful comments are often allowed like the one about Refuges living in five star hotels especially if the lie is about someone without influence or money.  Spam and Scam comments filter through without issue on every other comments section. Even though they are off topic irrelevant and possibly harmful to those who click the links.  They seem to suck up your personal data like  a lizard on the wall as soon as you set up an account your device gets logged and your comments and content is their manipulative hands. They decide what gets seen and what get's hidden , what get's retained and who's comment's are promoted usually idiotic and partisan ones to keep the grade low. Basically if you like speaking out about your own government when they get stuff wrong and it goes unchallenged  Facebook is not for you. The desperate legacy  media seem to be up Facebooks rear as do a lot of virtual signalling  charities and institutions , who'd rather keep virtual signalling while getting away with censorious and corrupt practices.   They're for there are a lot of hyperbole Facebook scandals get a superficial run  in the papers but next to no  insightful reporting on shadow bans and political censorship.  Unless it's happening to a global rival. Many media editors seem to do well out of Facebook  pages as they get to orchestrate a false public consensus over many matters.  Oh yeah , then there are the fake interests groups be they about your favourite TV prog or sports teams run by so called fans with a mountain of rules , which they can't even abide by themselves basically I posted something that was not a photo in one a bit off topic , a group admin did the same with an equally irrelevant post and this was allowed.  Like many other platforms Facebook is a toxic hypocrisy of a social network. I doubt Zuckerberg cares for anyone but himself and his own power. The media lap up Facebooks crocodile  tears about safe spaces and freedom of speech the way the media of a dictatorship would.

In the beginning, I create embattled archetypes that represents issues facing us today and comment on the human condition.  I did a series of masked women in lingerie and military uniforms. I write alot about why I do the type of art I do.  They gave me a hard time about this. These paintings were done in Oaxaca and got into the Cervantino art Festival, the most prestigous art festival in Mexico by famous curators and shown at the Museo de Alhondigas in Guanajuato. I put up ads and they refuse them and have taken my money on some occassions. I have complained. They don't return my money. They have become an obstacle in my ability to make money and be seen. I live in a small town, so it matters that I have internet presence and its what helps drive traffic for sales and my survival.   They are unsupportive of the small business and especially artists. I know alot of artists that are leaving facebook because of constant censorship. I have followed their guidelines and they still censor me. Now I can't log in on my computer if I restart my computer. Even though I have the correct email and password. Now I have to have it texted to my phone and because my phone wasn't working I have to go thru a process to identifying myself, which I did in which they told me it could take up to 48 hours and still nothing. I do make sales on facebook, I get messages and when I am unable to answer right away I loose sales. Therefore, if you are an artist who does cute animals and flowers, you will do good on facebook, because they only know commercial art, but not the that type of art that has meaning.  But if you do art that is edgy, has meaning, comments on the human condition and inspires people you will be censored. I am leaving facebook. I will go to instagram and google.

Shopify disconnected it for safety as I can no longer use my FB account. Due to this I'm going to be looking at taking legal action against meta for loss or earnings.

284,Facebook,2022-05-30T02:22:56.000Z,1,"As both a business owner and user of Facebook, it is my belief that they care not of decency and basic humanity. I'm not even making this up, they literally reward people who stay on the platform for hours on end, and punish those who do not. So if you happen to have a life where you can't be glued to their platform for hours on end, you're probably experiencing a decline in your reach and engagement on your posts these days. On the opposite end, if you're the type who spends hours on Facebook posting every meal, every life event, and gets lost in Stories, and memes, etc, then it's likely you love Facebook because you're not experiencing the same penalties as those who don't or can't spend that kind of time on the platform. Their extraordinarily strict policies and plethora of algorithms are destroying businesses by the handful. Those who aren't in this category are oblivious to this fact. It's unfortunate that SO many fellow business owners, to include myself, are being restricted and blocked from running Ads, and worse, simply because of errors in their algorithms. My account was restricted for over 6-months (I couldn't run a single Ad), and after multiple requests for review I finally received an email response saying my account was restricted in error and has been restored and ""sorry for the inconvenience"". However, by that time my business was already severely impacted and my Ads never performed the same again (likely because of one or more algorithms perpetually attached to my profile). I found out (from a ""Facebook Ad Expert"") the lack of performance is likely because all my customers and clients and potential leads who were attached to my pixel had fallen off because of the extended time. So I basically had to start from scratch to build that pixel back up. Similarly, my personal account remains restricted because it was never resolved and I was told, also via email (because that's the only support available) there was nothing they could do. All it would take to resolve this issue would be to speak with an ACTUAL PERSON. Since that's not an option with Facebook anymore, unless you happen to be among the elite, an 8-figure or more business owner, honest business owners like myself have to suffer. I'm currently shifting my business model to operate without Facebook, and unless someone with a higher moral conscience than ""Z"" and his fellow billionaire and millionaire executives takes over, I'm done. Let's really think about this for a second: As of the date of this post, Facebook has a total of 11,171 reviews on Trustpilot™. Of those reviews, only 14% of them are 5 stars and 68% of them are 1 star (2, 3, and 4 stars are 5%, 6%, and 7%, respectively). That speaks volumes! Sure, I'll check the little box at the bottom of this text box that says ""Let Facebook know about your review..."" My guess is that I won't ever hear from anyone to discuss resolution and my Facebook accounts will likely be completely shut down in retaliation. Then I'll have to post another 1 star.Prove me wrong Facebook, and I'll change/update my rating. Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before karma bites you in the booty.",0

Non existent Customer Service or help that was of any use on YouTube etc. Tried calling phone company etc. Have password and email but no way in my own account.

With a very cool leisure area down below called the ‘Rave Cave’ we had plenty to enjoy at night with games and an extensive selection of DVD’s. The food selection and menu planning was diverse and delicious. With a 10 and 14 year old we were unsure we would find something that we all agreed on but we had plenty to delight us and Mark and Martina cooked it beautifully. We were meant to have one night in, but the food was so delicious we decided to stay home.

339,Facebook,2022-09-06T19:59:12.000Z,1,I have been happily Facebook free for a year now. I thought being social media it would be good to start a Facebook page to make contacts and I needed to provide email what a MISTAKE looked for private settings and thought that would work but no still showed all my personal information. I then had every scammer in the world bombard me with emails and Facebook requests. I thought I better report it and get this stopped but seemed Facebook thought Scammers were not a problem on their platform and why would it be it’s an advertising platform not a social connection site well not anymore. So Facebook sat back making their usual revenue while I spent at least 2 full days trying to block as many unsavoury scammers as possible with no help from Facebook who ignored my pleas exhausted afterwards I logged in and found more pages full of scammer requests all from mostly third world and some of the pictures were very violent and disturbing so reported them to Facebook with images. Still no stepping in and then I woke up and smelt the coffee yet another big company that cares not about it’s users but the big bucks from bombarding you with adverts in fact I couldn’t even read the posts I wanted because between blocking scammers day after day and being bombarded with FB adverts I realised it wasn’t a nice place run by nice ethical people and closed my Facebook down . That wasn’t the end of it though because Facebook scammers still had my email account and so would fill up my email inbox with things like the usual if I contacted this email I’d receive a large sum of money and all manner of disturbing scams and some on investigation were not third rate little scammers but huge sophisticated organisations of criminals that were dangerous! I reported all this to action fraud and eventually it slowed down. That’s my experience of Facebook and as you have probably guessed will not be returning to scammer paradise again edit I forgot to add I had another Facebook account a long time ago and the reason I left it so long before testing the waters again with Facebook was because that account was hacked and I was locked out of it,0

In recent times Facebook has implemented ""Suggested for you"" which suggests similar businesses, pages, posts, etc., on Pages as well as personal feeds. As an owner of a handful of pages I was not advised that they were doing this, and found out that people viewing the pages are being shown posts for other pages/groups instead of being shown the posts for the actual page they are viewing. In one page (if not more) the suggested posts were completely unrelated as they took one word out of the page description and used it out of context as the sole basis of the ""suggestions"".Facebook's response would no doubt be something like ""but we gave you a way to opt out of the suggested posts"". Of course they are technically true - but the way to opt out involved going into each page 1 by 1 and clicking through multiple screens to get to the relevant option. When you get to the correct page, the actual option to deselect is cryptic - you are required to deselect the option to suggest your page on other pages, with a by-product of that selection being that other pages are not suggested on your page.As for suggestions appearing in your personal feed (or when logged in as a Page), tough luck. There is no option to turn it off, instead it tells you that you can hide posts you don't want to see. This doesn't help at all as it just suggests an almost identical post from  another person/page.Just let us use your site without forcing unnecessary changes that only serve to confuse and disenfranchise readers of pages.",1

I spent 2 years building an Instagram account from scratch, it recently was stolen in a hack and is posting bitcoin posts. The security is easily bypassed. There is NO response from Facebook/META and there is no place to contact Instagram.  Except for one USA based phoneline.  I have reported the hacked account dozens of times, reported the scam bitcoin posts. Reported it on the only form available on META/FB 'Report a bug"".  I've replied to the Google mail sent regarding the suspicious activity. I have asked others to report the account. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING F4OM INSTAGRAM. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Meanwhile my carefully gathered and nurtured contacts are being inundated with BITCOIN SPAM.Lack of Security and support has left me extremely vulnerable. The hacker knows exactly who I communicate with via message. Has as many personal details as is on my account . Within one minute a phone no. Apparently from Nigeria +2349085451773 took over my account,  changed the name, from PoetLoui to Poetloui55 they changed the  email and added an app to protect the NEW USER. All in under 1 minute.I received emails from Google that suspicious activity occurred on my Instagram, but all links to secure the account were useless/invalid as the account name,  everything,  was changed so quickly. Instagram has absolutely no point of support for me to communicate with in the UK. Or anywhere.When you Google ' my Instagram account was hacked it says to change the email address  BUT THATS ALREADY BEEN DONE! The ONLY advice ANYONE had is to contact further online hackers who can retrieve your account for a cost. WHAT A CON!AND INSTAGRAM AND FB OR Meta now, suppress all your natural traffic to your page , add shadow banning and STILL expect you to PAY for advertising and increased traffic.

Nothing was too much trouble and the customer care was superb. A special mention for Mario in the restaurant who treated us like with the most wonderful care and attention.

Craig (the owner) doesn’t just sell optical products.  He is knowledgeable in fitting his customers with what THEY need at a price comfortable for them.  I know from experience other optical outlets try to upsell or deal in inferior products, pointing out there opticasl are a cheaper buy.There’s an old adage: “I’m too poor to buy cheap.”  At Tom Stevens you don’t need to worry about buying something inferior only to have to replace it in the near future.  Craig stands behind what he sells and takes the time to explain how to derive maximum benefit (care, etc) for the products he sells.Yes, you can go to a big box store and probably purchase something cheaper.

Nonetheless, I secretly continued reporting these things and had pretty good success getting them removed.Again, I’m not reporting stuff I just don’t like. I’m talking about profiles that have no content or 1 picture posted within the last few hours, with fake names like “Iamso Overit” or “Faq Hughbich” etc. or profiles that literally post Russian propaganda every 10 seconds or swarm “laugh” reacts on news articles about death, etc. Facebook has now BLOCKED MY ABILITY TO REPORT ABUSE. After about 30 minutes of doing this and taking several profiles down today, suddenly the report abuse buttons just ‘don’t work.’ Everything else does, though.At this point FB is becoming a serious liability and safety threat to users. It’s not even about their inconsistent approach to moderation, they are literally stripping users of the ability to report someone abusing them or others.

The result is that they have banned my account for life!There is no customer support to speak to in order to get this sorted. Terrible Service",0
