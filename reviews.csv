Tones of offensive videos, involving child nudity, are not taken down, because they do not break their community standards. I hope, that one day, this facebook crap will stop existing. They should be ashamed of themselves."

Facebook,2023-03-08T16:49:48.000Z,1,"My 15 year old account was hacked three weeks ago.  Within minutes, Facebook sent a curt message saying it had breached their code of standards and been shut down, and that this decision is irreversible.  So, I've lost dozens of friends, years of memories and countless photos.  My Instagram account was shut down the same day. It feels like being burgled and ransacked. It's also in breach of the law:  I have the right to access my own data but just try contacting Facebook to get that to happen.  The experience has completely shattered my faith in Meta.  Their monopoly on social media is a security outrage."

My Account was hacked and someone paid through my app a Advertisement for a car, (way below market value) and due to Facebook messenger not being with the modern times it never notifies you as a normal message would. I just randomly checked my marked place noticing ive advertised something? I checked and i find a cheap car. I quickly deleted it, then checked my messenger only to find floods of message's enquiring about a car. I noticed on the messages the scammer had replied and directed them to a email. I told the useless meta/facebook all they did was go in circles eventually saying they found nothing suspicious. I am surprised how pathetic this company is to say its huge ."

But when I called the person a racist a*hole, I got a temp ban on my account.Not the first time this has happened.  Seen many abusive posts that facebook will claim are perfectly fine, racist/homophobic slurs, wishing violence on someone, even threatening to leak someones private information, and the moderation team will claim it doesnt go against their rules, despite the fact you can find the very rules these comments are breaking in facebooks guidelines.These people will be protected, but if you say anything to them, YOU are the one that will get a warning placed on your account, followed by a temp ban."

Facebook,2023-02-22T08:42:23.000Z,1,You report a blatant scam with visual proof of the scammer and the link they're using to scam people and they do nothing they leave that person to keep sending their scams out to other people. They go on about their policies but yet are a fraud and allow scammers to continue even with all the proof you could ever need to prove it. So I see these just as bad if not worse then the scamming pieces of crap they allow to go on

Facebook,2023-02-20T19:07:28.000Z,1,"Facebook, with its arrogant autistic Team, is blocking videos posted on Instagram and shared on Facebook, based on the argument that the videos are infringing music copyrights! So, we can post videos on Instagram, adding the music from their database, without any issues, but on Facebook we infringe rights? Do they check even the origin of the videos posted? Customer Service on Facebook is nil, zero, nada! I guess they have a bunch of kids running the platform!"

Facebook,2023-02-26T00:29:30.000Z,2,"I have been using Facebook for a few years now, and while the platform has some benefits, I have to say that I am disappointed with the overall experience. The platform is often cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to find the information I need or engage with my friends and family. The algorithmic timeline has become increasingly frustrating, as it often shows me irrelevant or repetitive content and seems to prioritize advertising over authentic interactions. I am also concerned about the privacy and security of my personal data, given the recent controversies around Facebook's data handling practices. While Facebook does provide a way to connect with friends and family, I am finding it increasingly difficult to justify using the platform given its many downsides. Overall, I would give Facebook a 2-star rating."
Facebook,2023-02-28T18:21:36.000Z,1,"I posted about a political event taking place in Washington D.C. and it involves people protesting the war in Ukraine and the spending of billions of USD for military aid by Congress. Some dumbfounded independent 'fact-checker' label my post as false information and I'd clicked to see why, it states ""false claims about WHO pandemic accord resurface online"" by AFP United States. How's this relevant to my post again?Facebook is a terrible and unsafe platform that it can't hide the fact it's biased towards certain people and yet others post inappropriate content that are harmful or not suitable for children. Facebook works for the government by the request of agencies such as the FBI on anything that they consider 'misinformation' by which Mark Zuckerberg admitted on Joe Rogan Experience show.Facebook has faced multiple lawsuits in the past for illegally sharing and tracking user's data, illegal monopolization, causing depression, etc."

Facebook,2023-02-11T13:25:17.000Z,1,Two years ago I responded to an add on Facebook reference a crypto trading company called Genesis11.Whilst assuming Facebook would not allow thieves to advertise on their platform and celebrities like Martin Lewis and Philip and Holly and others recommending this investment scam I signed up and lost £13000 before realising it was a scam.I noticed that scammers are still advertising on Facebook today and I hold them responsible for assisting scammers to steal from Facebook members.I Believe I am due a response from Facebook to explain how this can happen.

Now again,  I'm awaiting delivery on one item where I keep getting feedback that it's almost here,  but never arrives.  The other product from Leputon.com which appear to be legitimate,  which I vetted at the time of purchase because I can no longer trust you,  Facebook to give me legitimate marketing.  I thoroughly very any product advertised on your platform. THAT'S YOUR JOB TO DO, NOT MINE!!!!! You earn a fortune of money the least you could do is to employ a team to vet your advetisees, or get back in your lane and stop marketing products. Leave that to Amazon, ebay and the likes as at least they give one backup protection against a bad seller. I'm now again waiting on in table purchased through your media page,  I've contacted the company 4 times to no avail. I've threatened them,  I've demanded refunds.

Facebook,2023-02-08T00:58:03.000Z,1,"Facebook hasn’t necessarily aged well in comparison to the other social media sites used today. Security is atrocious, adding a two-factor authentication method is way over-complicated and doesn’t work for most main stream users, instantly causing vulnerabilities. Scams and fraud are frequent, and when reported to Facebook, nothing is done about them. The interface is dated, sluggish and unappealing. Customer service is poor, simply can’t speak to a human with security concerns. Honestly considered deleting my account and just sticking to Instagram/Discord, but seen as I’m required to keep it through employment I have to. Definitely not my platform of choice and would not recommend on security grounds."

It went from a fun app to a horrible place you have no voice in anything and can’t get any help . I have an indefinite ban because of someone else hacking my page and they won’t accept my ID knowing it’s the same person but names don’t match . This is insane something has to give .
Facebook,2023-02-19T10:27:07.000Z,1,"I've recently become so fed up with Facebook in general. For 1 thing there are far too many adverts and scams. Also, alot of the content they allow for public viewing is in my view deliberately chosen to provoke reactions such as cruelty to babies or animals, scantily clad women, people taunting the police, violence, or people just doing really mundane things. Facebook don't seem to have any filters for these posts, so when I comment on some of these people's posts they are very angry with me which is ridiculous. What do they expect? In return I have been getting stupid warnings from Facebook saying my comments go against their standards and then they put a block on my account. I don't get it. Facebook is a platform to comment or share your experiences, yet when you do comment on something you get told off. Makes no sense to me whatsoever. 🤔 I have complained to Facebook about some of the offensive material that gets posted but nothing seems to be done about that. Facebook needs someone in authority unrelated to them, to go in there and sort them out because they're operating in a very unscrupulous way. 😡"

Recommends countless pages or groups of stuffthat literally makes me cringe and when I instruct the app to stop recommending me these things it almost seems to happen more.

IE- FB allows foul language, swear words and threats all the time, in both posts and videos .Some of this allowed content is also inherently racist, ageist and misogynist, yet  they have blocked polite replies which use these terms in describing related insults.It's almost as though those at FB who monitor, don't understand these terms fully.It would be so much more helpful if FB could specify exactly WHAT they object to and WHY.And the Appeals Process should be more  transparently and inclusive  And the related FB complaints process is obtuse, ambiguous and tediously unhelpful."

They ban you for a month for writing b1tch but they refuse to even delete the profile of an adult who is writing very inappropriate things to your 9 year old little brother fully well knowing he is 9. All facebook did was delete the inappropriate things which would actually help the disgusting adult had it became a situation where the authorities had to be called. I called the man a b1tch using my little brother's profile and facebook banned me for 30 days instead of this adult who wasn't even banned for 1 day. It's all about the words you use. If you say b1tch you get banned for 30 days but if an adult is using so called polite words to describe highly inappropriate things to a 9 year old then its completely OK. Get off facebook and get the children off facebook and stay away from it as if it were a deadly disease. There are many other much more efficient and better monitored social media sites out there.

I paid for an online live stream of a football match on Facebook, and along with hundreds of other users, was not granted access to the live stream. While this serious bug is shocking, what's way worse is that when I raised a refund request, it was immediately rejected with no reason given. After I repeated the same simple message that I didn't get what I paid for, the furthest I got was a ""we're investigating the issue"". That was 5 days ago. It's been one week after the match and the event page still tells me to ""Get access"" for the fee, and I have not been refunded.I have seen screenshots of the same ""Sam"" CSO replying to others, but somehow Facebook's modus operandi is to pretend nothing went wrong. In one case, ""Sam"" even tried to push the support ticket to Google, somehow blaming them when the user made no use of Google's services and providing a link to Google's support channel. So far the only way people have gotten refunds is through their payment channel (PayPal, Revolut, etc), when this should have been a straightforward mass refund. I'm astonished that a giant company like Facebook can't get their act together, is not above blatantly stealing money, and have such appalling customer service."

Facebook,2023-01-11T06:17:56.000Z,1,"Facebook is a platform that should be avoided at all costs. I recently fell victim to a hack on my account, despite taking all of the necessary precautions such as using a strong and unique password and enabling two-factor authentication. To make matters worse, the hacker accessed my account from the other side of the world and Facebook did not took action. Despite this, Facebook failed to adequately protect my data and was no help in resolving the issue. To add insult to injury, I was lucky to have removed Facebook from my PayPal approved automatic payments just before the hack, otherwise, I would have suffered a significant financial loss.Not only does Facebook fail to provide adequate security, but their customer service is non-existent. When my account was compromised, they locked me out without any action on my part and didn't contact me back. I have to wait until 59 days knowing the hacker is still in the business/ad asset.All Facebook seems to care about is collecting money through advertising and selling private data, they even have the audacity to ask you to raise money for charity on your own birthday but when it comes to providing a basic service to ensure the security of your data, they fall short."

Now it seems someone is running an advert under my page, and I have my PayPal associated with it. I tried to delete my PayPal and now asking me to pay money that I didn’t spend, but rather whoever hacked my page. I now deleted my Facebook account completely because there is no way in the world I will pay this money. I’m so shocked how Facebook/meta is so useless with help and support. If they have acted over a week ago when I reported the issues, I would not be in this situation.

Facebook,2023-01-05T12:04:32.000Z,2,"Please stop forcing unwanted changes on users. In recent times Facebook has implemented ""Suggested for you"" which suggests similar businesses, pages, posts, etc., on Pages as well as personal feeds. As an owner of a handful of pages I was not advised that they were doing this, and found out that people viewing the pages are being shown posts for other pages/groups instead of being shown the posts for the actual page they are viewing. In one page (if not more) the suggested posts were completely unrelated as they took one word out of the page description and used it out of context as the sole basis of the ""suggestions"".Facebook's response would no doubt be something like ""but we gave you a way to opt out of the suggested posts"". Of course they are technically true - but the way to opt out involved going into each page 1 by 1 and clicking through multiple screens to get to the relevant option. When you get to the correct page, the actual option to deselect is cryptic - you are required to deselect the option to suggest your page on other pages, with a by-product of that selection being that other pages are not suggested on your page.As for suggestions appearing in your personal feed (or when logged in as a Page), tough luck. There is no option to turn it off, instead it tells you that you can hide posts you don't want to see. This doesn't help at all as it just suggests an almost identical post from  another person/page.Just let us use your site without forcing unnecessary changes that only serve to confuse and disenfranchise readers of pages."

Reporting spam and scams doesn't do anything, you simply get a bot message that they didn't remove the accounts or replies because there's nothing wrong according to their garbage automated systems.. You see the same telegram scam bots everywhere lately and the usual 'Go to this person's Instagram to get your page/account back' scams, but when you report them literally nothing happens because Facebook says it's 'not against the rules'.. Are you shitting me? So you're telling me that it's totally fine for these clowns to hack your page/account and there's nothing that you're able to do because it's not against the rules? What a utter joke.2. If your account/page is hacked, Facebook will do literally nothing to help you recover it. They don't even know who you are yet they have all your data which they sell off to other websites/platforms itself such as Google.3. Apparently it's okay for pages to post 'sexual suggestive' content but when you do it on your own Facebook account, you literally get banned for 30 days because of 'sexual suggestive content' ? What a joke.4. They are doing nothing against bots (Same as YouTube) who are promoting scams on their website.5. People can say the most heinous stuff possible on Facebook and nothing will happen but when i call someone a idiot/moron, i get banned for 30 days because of 'Harassment/violence and terrorism' ? Are you kidding me? (And yes this actually happened once).6. 0 ways of actually directly communicating with their support which should be a basic feature of any website, especially social media websites/platforms.7. A broken mobile app that hasn't seen any improvement for a long time now... I'm still having the same issues over and over where the mobile app will randomly throw me out and ask me to sign in again, why is this STILL a thing? I could go on but these are right now my main frustrations. Facebook is a multi-billion dollar website/platform and have more money than most people on the planet will ever have yet they are to incompetent to actually improve?

Facebook,2023-02-07T16:32:43.000Z,1,"I have always had a sense of being manipulated by Face Book which has eventually turned into a belief. I only signed into it a few years ago owing to a extra curricular group I'm involved with making it impossible to do otherwise. Prior to that I read an article where some celebraties gave very good and valid reasons as to why they avoided all social media , until 2020 I was also in that better camp.  When I arrived on Facebook I soon had a 100  friends. In time I've found them to be less than contacts. I also noticed how face book is at war with the  personal   freedoms of inididuals and the very design of it seems to suggest it should change its name to Noose Book. Constantly sending you sensational click bait and state sponsored  propaganda  , commenting and reacting let alone offering a rational point of view is a waste of time and can often be a bare foot walk on a razor blade.  It's not obvious at fist that if you comment on an article in your own spare time that so called friends get to see the comments as Facebook streams our info around regardless of context or relevance. Hang on I play  football and have other interests and groups non of which I want to trumpet my political opinions or rational least of all set myself up for their stupid judgments.  Facebook is the equivalent of moving into a new shinny town with all the modern amenities and many for a price. Then having  to walk around and go about your daily business with a sandwich board attached to your person conveying  all of  you personal info at all times and often being directed by a Facebook cop most of the time into one bad situation after another( true there  are ways to ring fence a lot but that is never the defualt setting when  it should be ). Which is profitable to their world city  hall.      During the  Covid  crisis I took a very strong view on the deniers and corrupt behaviour  of the UK governments , not only was I shunned and labelled as a Troll by my  peer group without so much as a discussion  I was also sent charming threats by keyboard warriors and like others have said when you retaliate  to someone you got in an account warning again the Robotic and ire-rational system, seldom factors in context or balance. It's not in Facebooks interests like their ethos of  low over heads , click bait and fake news are. A certain amount of free speech  is whipped up and thrown a few scraps of meat  but then the cage is shut.  Facebook will decide how your'e comments appear or don't it actually has nothing to do with they're so called guidelines. If Facebooks want's to ensure that your comments are only visible  to the people your criticising  or Trolls with an opposing view it will do that.   As a user you have to spend a lot of time putting  up your own fences data wise as the default set up is designed to leave individuals vulnerable and exposed  , When I set up my Facebook account I was naive .   They no longer seem to ban comments or issue penalties ,now they behave in a more underhanded way , that low overheads factor at play , perhaps. Comments can be hidden , shadow banned and never seen . If that's not 198-4 enough they also have a sinister  new feature called help. Basically instead of reporting a user you can press help and that's a handy way to silence those you disagree with as their comments will be shadow banned , of the back of some virtually anon user acting  state nurse. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy against the people , allows loads of hateful comments about Refugees , women and other historically vulnerable groups , I must state however I see little in the way of anti Jewish comments being allowed to fly through even the odd stereotypical  joke but several about Muslims all being , bad people in so many different news comments.  It's clear our politicians  are silly and enjoy too much power they let unhinged narcissists  and socially stunted individuals  like Zuckerberg strut around like the inheritor of the earth , despite his only life experience being from the dorm to the boardroom. I also notice if you comment about a over population of rich Chinese students in the UK and question what that brings to British society that also gets shadow banned or driven into unfriendly traffic.   Ultimately it is  clear that Facebook cares next to nothing about the safety of people there privacy  or well being . Everything about pushing the interests of the one per cent and keeping the masses baying at each other like a bunch of deranged wolf's .          In the real world away from American and Chinese controlled social media you get to chose what to share and when to do it . Surprisingly  in this technically advanced age of so called personal democracy social media in the main takes it cue from the village depicted in the old TV series by Patrick McGoghan"

Facebook,2022-12-27T14:22:03.000Z,1,Someone created a fake page in my boyfriend's name and other things. We have reported most of the year. Facebook hasn't done anything about. They have no customer service phone number.
Facebook,2022-12-26T19:56:39.000Z,1,Had to close my account completely and start again after multiple hacking and very disturbing images shared on my account.  The fact you cannot speak or contact a human with a problem makes it worse. They also never answer reports other than to tell you  your feedback is will help them make improvements.
Facebook,2022-12-26T13:14:37.000Z,1,"Restricted for 3 days when at work and didn’t post anything. Says against community standards, child nudity or sexual exploitation.

Facebook,2022-12-25T10:59:03.000Z,1,"We've received blackmail demands and threats through Instagram messaging but Facebook won't shut the person's account down as its not in breach of their guidelines. So, to me, this implies blackmail and threats are ok then if they're not posted on a feed. Seriously, where's the safety and protection? They're impossible to contact when you have an emergency and left you're totally vulnerable. The police have been called and given the evidence so hopefully they can help as there is a blackmailer targeting people with the blessing of Facebook."

I was going through a difficult time in life and isolating myself came automatically.A few days ago I wanted to recreate a FB account again, to give the account all the information about me, starting from my early childhood: primary school, high school, university, early work experience, etc.At some point, I encountered the first problems. I decide to publish a post with a photo where I am more than recognisable, complete with date and place (a trip with friends to a nature park in Vienna).The problems do not cease, I decide to make the first friend request, to a previous acquaintance.I receive the first blocking notices and a request to provide my mobile phone number to verify myself. I do so, receive a text message and proceed.The next day: here is the result:""""""You cannot use Facebook or Messenger because your account, or activities within it, have not met our Community Standards.We have already checked this decision and it cannot be reversed.To find out more about why we disable accounts, see our Community Standards.""""""Now I ask myself: is there anyone who is able to give me a single, minimal, sensible reason to waste the time in life again with these fake, social, incompetent imbeciles?"

No. Do I want to give my passport to access the trivial drivel that is facebook? No. The great irony.Facebook the social media site that cant communicate with its customers.
Facebook,2022-12-23T04:35:47.000Z,1,So I have been banned from Facebook for no apparent reason my ban got lifted then got put on a other ban straight away because I shared a memory on my page. First I got banned for apparently posting something that goes against the rules which was a photo off my dog. I got banned for 24 hours for posting that then got put on a other ban for 2 days but they where not happy with giving myself that ban they put me on a other ban for 26 days which is a joke the people who run Facebook should look at all the scammers they are letting away with scamming people instead off banning people for stupid things like sharing memories. All I can say is the people that monitor Facebook need to have a good look at all the stuff they are letting happen on the app instead off banning people for stupid things. One last thing people should be aware of is that Facebook also watches your chat log so if people are talking about private things with family and friends be careful because they are watching your chat which is in breach of your privacy.
Facebook,2022-12-22T20:27:20.000Z,1,"Facebook are at it again. Apparently I have tried posting something, four times, of something that goes against community standards. I haven't even been on Facebook today, or at the very least, posted anything. I've been at work.  This really is the bottom feeder of social media. This is the final insult. Facebook can officially do one. I will never waste data or WiFi bandwidth on their dog toilet company again. Utterly diabolical how they treat people for absolutely nothing. Oh and they are too afraid to reply to you. I thought it was innocent until proven guilty."

Very difficult to manage followed pages. Difficult to review activity log. Separating home and 'feeds' is a nonsense. It hasn't been fun for a long time but now it's actually getting to the point where its difficult to use. Managing profiles and pages is now so complex you need a degree in coding to understand it. Such a shame. It felt like a movement at one stage, now it feels like a one way railroad into a quagmire."
Facebook,2022-12-20T03:08:32.000Z,1,"How people have allowed this platform to be in existence still is astonishing.You are not allowed to speak your mind, you are not allowed to be honest, you have to lie and you have to be a snowflake if your posts are to remain posted.It is surpression done on a level that is unacceptable, totally unacceptable.Yet people continue to pay them lots of money to advertise. The way to remove FB is for someone of intelligence to build another platform but with this on the title ""WE ALLOW FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND WE DO NOT SURPRESS YOU"", then you watch FB collapse.FB will not be about forever, but they could be gone in a few years if someone would just produce another platform and allow FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.  Every single other ""social media"" platform would go under, in a heartbeat.I beg someone of intelligence to undertake this and prove to us that FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION is still alive and not being surpressed by the likes of FB.Thanks. FB, what goes around, comes around and one day, soon I hope, it comes around to you and removes you and your vile platform from this World, permanently."

Facebook,2022-12-15T09:32:14.000Z,1,"If you are one of the advertising partners placing paid ads, there is a good chance Facebook incorrectly charged your credit or debit card, your Paypal or your bank account. That's what happened to me. And the process of getting your money back is next to impossible when you try to resolve the issue directly with Facebook. Most people tend to take the fight up with their credit card company to get the charges reversed, but in this case it won't work, because the charge was placed by METAPLATFORMS to my Paypal account, but because at the time when METAPLATFORMS was placing the charge, my Paypal account balance was $0.00 (zero). So Paypal has sent the Facebook's charge into my bank account. What's strange (bizarre) that neither Paypal nor Facebook did not invoice me for the charge and did not document it at all. I can't report it as FRAUD to my bank since the charge came via Paypal and Paypal is not cooperating well since the charge went into my bank and is undocumented by Paypal. While Facebook or Meta Platforms or Meta or whatever else name they disguise themselves under and their ads payment support  and all this maze of Facebook/Meta supports denies the charge and is asking for a reference number for that particular unauthorized undocumented uninvoiced charge while there is NO reference number under my bank account, only the following description: INST XFER ID:METAPLATFOR INDN:""MYFIRSTLASTNAMEHERE"" CO ID:PAYPALSI77 WEB Other Payment"". I have provided this and screenshots to Facebook, but they are foiling throwing kicks and are ignoring my evidence. Clearly they must have allegedly charged millions or billions of users for the same or similar amount just to make more money. And Facebook has already charged me for a legally INVOICED (documented and agreed upon) amount for the ad they were running for me for a limited period of 7 days (and a full stop). This is a NIGHTMARE and I have now blocked Facebook from being able to remove even more money from my Paypal and bank accounts by removing Paypal payment method from my Facebook business ads page, but now Facebook posted the following under ""Go to Account Quality"" which is located under /accountquality/ — ACCOUNT RESTRICTED ""We couldn't process one of your payments. Pay the amount due to run ads again."" and ""Can't run ads"" — not that I want to use Facebook Ads (Meta whatever) ever again though! Beware!"

This is what happens when you have someone creating the standards, that does not have a solid command of english language. I used this expression, ""hit the nail on the head"". It means you are on point. It has nothing whatsoever to do with violence. This is not even censorship. It's simply ignorance. It is amazing that fb hires disqualified person for the job. Or some programmer was told if you find some keywords flag the post. In my case the words are  ""hit, hammer and the head"". That's is very sad and funny at the same time. Please like this so fb realizes that they are absolutely 100% wrong."
Facebook,2022-12-11T00:14:28.000Z,1,"I've used Facebook for almost 15 years. I've had an on again off again experience and somewhat of a love-hate relationship. I know they steal my data and manipulate me in many ways but it is a good way to share what is going on in our lives with our friends and family so I have stuck with it. Last year I started posting music and videos every day. These posts are important to me and I've used them to share about our lives and to teach others. Facebook automatically creates a memories list and shows posts from prior years and this list is neglecting to include these posts. Again, these posts are very personal and important to me, and I've spent a lot of time on them. I post every single day, almost like an online video blog. It's infuriating and discouraging that Facebook is purposely leaving them off of my memories list. They're doing it on purpose because even third party apps like Time Hop can't find them. I have reported the problem a dozen times and nobody at Facebook has gotten back to me so it's obvious that not only do they know about it, they're not going to do it anything about it. Facebook is curating my posts and leaving some of my important memories off based on some algorithm or criteria. If that sounds like what you want then by all means sign up."

So called   News feed's dripped in spam over load  from attention seekers I don't know and hope I never do. Most of the feeds are designed to stimulate , a strong comment. However Zoo Book likes to whip the negativity in the comments section to the point where the animal's (users) , rattle the cage and then the mods get out their stick and ban   a lot of comments that don't fit their main priority. Greed vested interest. Like most platforms they whip up a toxic level of hatful reactions and then either shadow ban the entire section  or manipulate time lines to suit the elites. Always click on show all comments to get a better picture of public  sentiment.  Silly comments are allowed , untruthful comments are often allowed like the one about Refuges living in five star hotels especially if the lie is about someone without influence or money.  Spam and Scam comments filter through without issue on every other comments section. Even though they are off topic irrelevant and possibly harmful to those who click the links.  They seem to suck up your personal data like  a lizard on the wall as soon as you set up an account your device gets logged and your comments and content is their manipulative hands. They decide what gets seen and what get's hidden , what get's retained and who's comment's are promoted usually idiotic and partisan ones to keep the grade low. Basically if you like speaking out about your own government when they get stuff wrong and it goes unchallenged  Facebook is not for you. The desperate legacy  media seem to be up Facebooks rear as do a lot of virtual signalling  charities and institutions , who'd rather keep virtual signalling while getting away with censorious and corrupt practices.   They're for there are a lot of hyperbole Facebook scandals get a superficial run  in the papers but next to no  insightful reporting on shadow bans and political censorship.  Unless it's happening to a global rival. Many media editors seem to do well out of Facebook  pages as they get to orchestrate a false public consensus over many matters.  Oh yeah , then there are the fake interests groups be they about your favourite TV prog or sports teams run by so called fans with a mountain of rules , which they can't even abide by themselves basically I posted something that was not a photo in one a bit off topic , a group admin did the same with an equally irrelevant post and this was allowed.  Like many other platforms Facebook is a toxic hypocrisy of a social network. I doubt Zuckerberg cares for anyone but himself and his own power. The media lap up Facebooks crocodile  tears about safe spaces and freedom of speech the way the media of a dictatorship would. Manny call Facebook leftwing and communist I disagree , it's nothing of the sort it's capitalism at it's worst.A world without Facebook would be a more free one I bet more people would take to the streets."

Facebook,2022-12-02T01:24:57.000Z,1,"I ran a ""Buy and Sell"" Group on Facebook with around 21k members and I tried to keep it free of spam, scams and illegal activities, unlike other Buy and Sells Groups on the platform because I took pride in the Group.But yesterday I logged into the Group and it was gone, all that was there was a notice saying, ""This content isn't available at the moment"".Then I receive an email from Facebook saying that the Facebook Group has been disabled.And that my Group has been reported multiple times for violating someone else's intellectual property rights and that I had been previously warned that if content posted to my Group continued to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, my Group would be disabled.I remember something a long while back mentioning something to that effect but when I clicked on the message to see what it was it didn't mention anything or show me the thing I ""supposedly"" infringed upon and so I put it down that it had been fixed as there was no information about anything.I do not know what Facebook expects people to do if there is complaints about infringement or anything for that matter if they do not give the people any information to rectify the problem.We are not ""mind readers"".I am dumbfounded by the way Facebook conducts itself in matters like this, because all they had to do was say we have had some complaints about this thing or that thing, and then show me what it is and then I would have fixed the problem, and there wouldn't have been any drama.But no, they had to do the whole song and dance routine and act tough by deleting my Facebook Group to show just how spiteful they really are.I do not know who hires the Staff at Facebook but they certainly need to be fired and the Staff retrained because other Facebook Groups can have Bestiality, Animal Abuse, Sex Scenes, Drug Selling posts in their Groups and Facebook does nothing, yet I have some type of infringement of an unknown nature, of which Facebook won't explain and I get my whole Group of 21 thousand members deleted.....""Totally Idiotic!"""
Facebook,2022-12-02T00:09:54.000Z,1,"To Whom it May Concern,My name is Candy Nutt-Melton and I am writing this because I am at my wits end trying to deal with my Facebook account. A few days before Thanksgiving I noticed posts that I did not post. I changed my password immediately. Thanksgiving Day while with family and not using Facebook a family member asked me about something I had just posted. I was not on my Facebook at the time. Yet I posted a four-bedroom house that I supposedly had for rent. I currently live in a bus. Any thoughts? The next day while chatting with a friend on messenger I received a notice that I had posted material that went against community standards. Within minutes I received a second notice that my account was locked and blocked from view. I at once began attempting to fix the issue. I had not posted anything; I was chatting with a friend. I at least wanted to see what I had apparently posted. I could not even find my account. Very upset I decided I would sleep on it and fix it the next day. It is now five days later, and I have attempted every support help fix I have found and called every number I have found. I have even uploaded a copy of my state ID to prove I am who I say I am. I did manage to see a partial view of the post and from what I could see I do fully agree that whoever posted it should have to deal with this. Not me. I continue to get a “sent code to phone and that it could take a few minutes” message only no code is ever sent, if a code is requested too many times it will lock, so I’m stuck waiting for a code. I requested code to change my password and I did receive code for that. I have changed my password several times over the last week. I eventually become angry and log out, and that’s when I get a message telling me my account is locked and that I have so many days to request a review. I have tried to find where and how to request a review. I found a section in the help guide that asked me to upload my ID, so I did. Received the message it could take up to 24 hours for them to look at it and decide if they were wrong they will unlock my account , if they decide that I am wrong than I will be banned. I have had my account for several years and never have I had any problems. I will be more than happy to provide all my personal information. I have not been asked any questions as to did I post this? Where am I located? Nothing. I have a large number of people that would gladly verify anything about me or anything I have ever posted on Facebook. I can even provide a list of people that do not like me that would verify the same as those that do. I do think Facebook was right to block the post. Although I strongly feel that before they lock someone’s account for review they should provide details of the steps the person should take to provide information that I feel should be included in that review. Much like so many others in the world Facebook is my contact with my family and friends. One difference for me is that due to my challenges with Agoraphobia at times it is my only contact with any one outside my home. Facebook has been the only contact I have had with the outside world for weeks at a time on many occasions. I am not upset that this happened. What I am upset about is the process Facebook is using. I have years of photos and Tags that people have sent me over the last several years attached to my Facebook account that will be lost if Facebook decides to delete my account. I feel like a child that is being punished for someone else’s actions. I am not even given the opportunity to speak on my behalf much less defend myself. Wait that is what’s happening only difference is I’m an adult. Great Moral Ethics Facebook!  Horrible Parenting! There is a right way to handle things. Then there seems to be the Facebook way. I am being punished because someone with nothing better to do Hacked my Facebook and posted photos promoting terrorists."

From what I have seen, the same thing that has happened to me, has happened to 1000's of other people.  How long can this go on for without a response from Facebook?  Accounts being hacked then disabled and no hope from recovering it.  Scams are being shown left, right and centre from hackers claiming they can regain access for a hefty fee.  You shouldn't have to pay to regain what was yours.  How is it ok to deny people access to their personal information but they can allow hackers to gain access?  Sort it out facebook"

I did that both posts got taken down the stress and anxiety I had suffered after deleting my Facebook.  I now can see why Facebook has a bad name it should change its name to finding friends/ looking for friends for people who are very lonely, sad  and seeking friendship in foreign countries and world wide and the people that work for Facebook and Meta should be redeployed or have their job titles changed I had to provide ID photos evidence URL  links and twice this happened these people are still happy using Facebook like they are ones who play the victim being the iniscent ones  it will never happen to them.

I used Facebook as a way of communicating with friends and family.  Their Admin Team who are meant to respond to complaints or are quick to block you, in most people's opinion don't know what they are doing.  Yesterday (17/11/22,  I had a lot of issues with bullying on the Ritchie Sunak Group.  This group to be honest has a majority of Indian followers and hardly any from the UK. Yesterday I was subject to bullying, hate speech, and racism.  I reported it to Facebook because one person said a dreadful thing about mutilation to me and then he removed it as it was so awful.  I reported it to Facebook and they send a standard response saying this does not go outside of our regulations!!  In addition on Remembrance Weekend, there were the most disrespectful and awful comments about our war heroes.  Again I reported and nothing, just it's within our rules so perhaps these people have no idea how people sacrificed their lives for us.  This week I shared a post regarding our war veterans and what they mean to the world but the group would not approve it!  I complained again but nothing.  You could even say that as this group only exists to worship Ritchi Sunak, they don't want to know the truth.  The group is also full of begging posts asking us for money and they think Rishi is Indian but he was born in the UK!  This can't continue to section out British people and individuals posting hate speech.  Yesterday I got called Ugly, and fat, my dogs look better than me plus racist comments towards white people.  Facebook Admin doesn't listen and act on issues!  Sadly I have to continue to use it and don't like Instagram so I have no choice."

I have spent the last couple of days reinstalling the files on the new hard drive as well as reinstating accounts where passwords have been lost.  Every other organisation has sent codes to reset passwords, but not Facebook. My profile photograph, e-mail and telephone number is displayed but despite asking on numerous occasions for codes to be sent none have arrived.  I run a Facebook Page for a local non-profit making marine conservation area that Facebook treats as a business.  Every time I post on the Page, Facebook tries to sell advertising saying that if I pay £14 the post will be boosted to reach more people, but I doubt what they say.  How can you possibly trust Facebook with this, or anything else, if they can’t even send codes to recover an account?  Anyone who tries to run a business solely on Facebook is misguided to say the least.    One might argue that using Facebook is free, but it isn’t, as in return for using it they have access to your personal details and show you advertisements.

I did absolutely nothing wrong. I am an innocent victim and there is no recourse. I lost everything - including a business page. We have a Discord group and it seems someone joins everyday with the exact same problem. Terrible company!"

I am trying to get help for it but it’s IMPOSSIBLE. How is it possible that freakin FACEBOOK has no help center that replies? And everytime you look for a solution it’s like “what to do when you accidentally did this” or “what do when somebody did that to your account “ but how about you take responsibility when your platform screws up and just help people? You clearly make enough money, so just have a help center that one can contact when there are issues. Bloody ridiculous, I honestly can’t believe how much of my time I’ve wasted on this."

Well, it is very much how this world runs & operates------REAL ""justice"" remains an impossible ideal & is very much only for the super powerful & rich, rarely for financially & politically marginalized us.But, there are many other choices that I can still voice out.

I had over 400 posts on marketplace.... hundreds of hours.  All lost. Tried to argue with the Bots many times and the loop goes round and round like a hamster wheel.  Facebook is shameful.  First they hook you and then kick your behind out for stupid reasons.  For someone who has 400 posts and uses the platform a LOT,  there should be a ratio of percentage of the minor mishaps vs the use put in play.

Facebook,2022-10-22T09:15:35.000Z,1,I have a major problem with Facebook because of Dual Authentication that uses your cell number if you forget the password. They requested you do that. I finally opened a new account under Steven Tessier My old account is under Steve Tessier. With Facebook you can send them your Driver’s License to change the password but the old cell number still gets the codes to retrieve the old Facebook account. So you can set up a new password but they send you a code to your old cell that you can’t retrieve. There is no way you can talk to a live agent. Basically Facebook doesn’t care about it’s users.

Personally I think those buttons are NOT proprietary. Thumbs up/down have been used since Roman times. I’ve seen thumbs up/down on other websites. I am not a lawyer but I think trademarking an icon as facebook did is not the same to me as having buttons on a remote in someone's home or trademarking a distinctive app icon to represent a company. I believe NO ONE should have proprietary rights over thumbs up/down. How can they bully tivo into deactivating those buttons? I think facebook should get over itself.

They have absolutely zero methods of getting in touch, there is no customer support at all. The sheer difficulty in submitting my ID alone was a nightmare, and now they're saying my account violated community guidelines and I have no way to add any form of appeal. All I can do is wait until they likely decide to permanently ban my account because there's no way to tell them my account was hijacked and that I did all I could in my power to protect and recover it. They fail everybody who needs their support. The only method I can see to get human support is if you buy an Oculus, or if you run ads with an accessible account. That's because money is involved. However, Facebook makes money from all of their users, and regardless of that, the bare minimum of human customer support should be present."

About time though that Facebook ended up in court for providing a platform for selling counterfeit goods.

Facebook,2022-09-22T01:50:05.000Z,1,"Facebook shut down my account for absolutely no reason. I hadn't posted in over two years, never commented or even looked at Facebook pages. I just used it for Marketplace, and never violated any TOS. I received a notification that my account had been disabled because I was apparently underage (I'm 27), so I had to verify with my license in the app. It then told me it was locked because I had posted something that was against the community TOS, which means that I was absolutely hacked. Facebook made me send in info again to appeal, but then immediately disabled my account permanently with no option to appeal. They have no one you can contact, no way to inform them that your account was hacked. It's mostly a minor inconvenience, but I preferred selling on marketplace to avoid eBay fees, so I'm pretty bummed about it, and it really highlights how insanely incompetent they are at managing their own security, I had 2FA on and the hacker somehow bypassed it without access to my authenticator."

That's also my case, my Facebook account was suddenly suspended. Everything was lost, including ad campaigns, business pages, history, etc.In my case, no official explanation was provided, and their support is inexistent. Based on your location, you may submit a formal complaint to Better Business Bureau, CA's Attorney General, CCPC Ireland, etc; none worked for me.1/23/2023 - It's still a common practice for hackers to post child exploitation images to disable people's Facebook accounts.Facebook has no security filters to protect personal accounts when suspicious activity is detected from other IPs or country."
Facebook,2022-09-21T06:25:13.000Z,1,First off Facebook is outdated. I get restrictions way to much for old posts which pop up as memories or from this day years ago .the stupid thing I ever heard up. Features outdated I get hacked all time . Policy stupid standard stupid tell the creators to step they game up . I like Instagram and tic tock way better I have never got banned once with any other account. I really hate Facebook it's kinda useless.  MySpace was better I made sure I posted this on all my accounts. I'm having several people complain of being banned on Facebook or Facebook jail for long periods it's stupid.  And they don't even investigate the problem reported fairly.  There's so many reasons I hate Facebook.  Tell the creators please create a whole new Facebook concept sence they made so much money cause I think Facebook a joke . Team Instagram and tick tock  here.

I work in film and television and have actors, producers, directors and colleges asking me if I have blocked them. Facebook offers no help or a way to contact them. The message only says I was against community standards, though I have not posted or done anything. Also that they are 'short staffed' and may never review the account. I could be done with Facebook completely, but my instagram has become such a critical tool in my work. This should not be allowed. I need to regain my information back!"

Their discrimination, mistreatment and hatred towards their members should not be allowed any further. If FB welcome just one languge, one point of view, one culture only then people with other views and backgrounds must not be allowed to the platform.

Facebook,2022-09-06T19:59:12.000Z,1,I have been happily Facebook free for a year now. I thought being social media it would be good to start a Facebook page to make contacts and I needed to provide email what a MISTAKE looked for private settings and thought that would work but no still showed all my personal information. I then had every scammer in the world bombard me with emails and Facebook requests. I thought I better report it and get this stopped but seemed Facebook thought Scammers were not a problem on their platform and why would it be it’s an advertising platform not a social connection site well not anymore. So Facebook sat back making their usual revenue while I spent at least 2 full days trying to block as many unsavoury scammers as possible with no help from Facebook who ignored my pleas exhausted afterwards I logged in and found more pages full of scammer requests all from mostly third world and some of the pictures were very violent and disturbing so reported them to Facebook with images. Still no stepping in and then I woke up and smelt the coffee yet another big company that cares not about it’s users but the big bucks from bombarding you with adverts in fact I couldn’t even read the posts I wanted because between blocking scammers day after day and being bombarded with FB adverts I realised it wasn’t a nice place run by nice ethical people and closed my Facebook down . That wasn’t the end of it though because Facebook scammers still had my email account and so would fill up my email inbox with things like the usual if I contacted this email I’d receive a large sum of money and all manner of disturbing scams and some on investigation were not third rate little scammers but huge sophisticated organisations of criminals that were dangerous! I reported all this to action fraud and eventually it slowed down. That’s my experience of Facebook and as you have probably guessed will not be returning to scammer paradise again edit I forgot to add I had another Facebook account a long time ago and the reason I left it so long before testing the waters again with Facebook was because that account was hacked and I was locked out of it

I don’t know how many times fake profiles have tried to con me or get me to click on what’s app or any other platform where they can hack your account. Soto the complaint, I’ve got a new fake profile. This person or organisation has multiple profiles with different names. I do the right thing by reporting these and guess what?? Yup, Facebook says that this does not go against their community standards.. face profiles are active and Facebook are refusing to take them down.. this is not the first encounter with these fake profiles and I doubt it will be my last. But what will stay the same is the ridiculous community standards that are putting peoples bank accounts at risk. It’s appalling that such a huge organisation can allow this and support these profiles"

We had to employ a techie to find out what the issue was as there was no way to contact Facebook directly and we couldn't login to disagree the decision.

Facebook responses back saying it doesn't go against Facebook community standards. When you look up the community standards it's pacifically says does not allow nudity at all.

You are simply out of line - the sheer arrogance you show, to treat a customer like this, when I have done nothing wrong is unacceptable.

I am a teacher, I have a child, I am not a hacker!! I'm so frustrated as there is no one to talk to, no one to appeal to and nothing I can do at all to stop my account being deactivated. I have friends from ten years+ ago, people I went to school and University with I will have no way of contacting. I have photos uploaded from since I was a teenager until now, with my son.

We live in Florida so we’re constantly at the beach, pool, waterpark, lake or just running around in the sprinkler in the back yard. I take a lot of pictures and I love seeing what we’ve done this time years ago on memories. The issue I keep having is that Facebook is recognizing my 10 year old boy as a fully grown woman going shirtless in board shorts. It’s an easy thing to explain but there is no one to reach out to. I’ve been restricted three times but I neither want to cut off my sons hair that he loves, stop posting pictures of our family or make a little boy wear a shirt at the pool. We’re currently at great wolf lodge for the week in North Carolina for a family vacation and I’m restricted for sharing a family picture at the indoor water park all where I’ll be taking pictures all week.

Two attempts at creating a new account with a new email have resulted in being locked out each time.  One message said I have to establish my identity with a credit card or passport scan.

I was abused by an Afro Caribbean American who use religious racial and abuse my disability.After complaining to Facebook and reporting him 20 or more times. I retaliated with a comment very similar to his own and they banned me! Facebook should not be policing itself it restricts free speech and is a far left Eco chamber. I have photographic evidence of me reporting 20 times to Facebook and I have photographic evidence of the abuse which they’ve allowed but my one comment which only minute the abuses got me banned because I’m white!

I was led to believe Facebook had in error displayed the wrong area, the item was advertised as being in Cardiff (I live in Swansea), and I was about to walk through the door to go buy the machine when the collection address sent to me was in Bodmin. After querying this and establishing Bodmin was correct address, arranged to have it sent and paid £20 extra for delivery. A few hrs later realised I had been scammed as my sisinlaw was told it was still for sale when she enquired after it as and I was spun several stories from there. Contacted Facebook numerous times to report the fraudulent transaction and ask for help and each time received a message saying that I would be contacted within 48hrs. No one ever contacted me about the matter. I thought that Facebook would have a duty of care to their users and had measures in place to verify its users identities?????

U can tell the ppl that runs Facebook is RACIST AND SEXIST AS WELL. I’m shocked that it’s even still around. Someone was called the N word and the comment was allowed to stay up, even now. It was on a post on Brightside. They wrote it in Philipino and there was the option for translation. The person responded but not with a racist word or anything and they were put in Facebook jail for one month. So I guess ONLY Black people get banned but racists and white supremacists are allowed “free speech”.

Real communications weighs greater importance than virtual communication. Facebook gives a license for people to turn nasty toward people they do not know.

If a comment on a site (for example Sky News) does not suit their agenda they ban you for the silliest comment and sometimes a very factual comment.  There are so many important issues in the world yet facebook are acting just the same as a communist nation would act.  Do as I say or we will ban you.  To have such a violent and immediate reaction to a comment I made stating if Joe Biden is returned to office then I will know that Americans do not understand how economics work and that they are stupid.   Voting for an ill man is insane.  If facebook disagrees with your leanings then you are banned.  Does this give rise to the rumours that facebook donates millions of dollars to the Democrat campaign. Is this the real reason I was banned for 24 hours?

STRIPE will not release any funds to new customers until you can prove via Facebook, with a tracking number, that you have posted the item your selling. Once you do this STRIPE will process the payment, but being a new customer it takes 10 days. So STRIPE sits on the funds for 10 days and possibly more so you would of thought they would have picked up the fact that the account or card used was fraudulent….

When I left facebook, I was totally fine. Have NEVER been banned. Have NEVER received any message telling me to stop posting anything questionable. Have NEVER had ANY post removed for anything that would have caused my account to be flagged.That said, I used a DIFFERENT email to sign up. I went to my wife's page and didn't see an ""Add Friend"" button, so I went to my friend's page and added him as a friend. Immediately after this, all of 30-45 seconds of being on facebook, I received a message that my account had been disabled upon further investigation. I was told that I could fight this decision by answering questions and posting a picture of me, so I did.I NEVER received an email about their final decision, but here is the EXACT text of what they wrote when I tried to log in my brand new account:""You can't use Facebook or Messenger because your account, or activity on it, didn't follow our Community Standards.We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed.To learn more about the reasons why we disable accounts, visit the Community Standards.""No reason. Nothing claiming I did anything wrong. No evidence that I did anything wrong. Just ""We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed."" I had not even had a chance to write a single post. Facebook decided to judge me based on, what? I really don't know.Apparently this is what facebook has become. Totalitarian and absolute. Facebook is only for those THEY choose to own accounts. Facebook has deteriorated into this mess that they are and no wonder they get poor reviews, accounts are deleted left and right, their apps are receiving poor reviews.I am highly offended that they disabled my account immediately and didn't offer any reason why except some vague, canned response that had NOTHING to do with me as I HAD NOT WRITTEN A SINGLE POST YET! They judged me BEFORE I had even set up my account.** UPDATE **I just created another facebook account using a brand new email that I just created for this purpose and account creation was successful, but, a moment later, after adding a friend, it said that my brand spanking new account was yet again locked. Again, I didn't even have time to create a post or add a friend or even update any of my profile. It just instantly locked me out and all I could do was challenge the lock out, just like the previous account. I have a feeling that they will keep this one locked as well and I will not be able to use facebook ever again for some twisted, shady, wicked reason by the facebook elites who love to lock and block people for no reason."

The El Resto restaurant where we had our daily breakfast and occasionally evening meals was first class with the most friendly and welcoming team of staff. Nothing was too much trouble and the customer care was superb. A special mention for Mario in the restaurant who treated us like with the most wonderful care and attention. The views over the Aegean see were idyllic and the breakfast to die for. We could walk down the hill each evening to the quiet and beach lined Agios Ioannis village where we hardly heard an English voice, only Greeks on holiday or weekend visits.

Facebook staff make rules as they go along, no stability nor logic is followed as it seems to me. A never ending horror story in my opinion. I am extremely disappointed.

For example I saw a meme about Batman beating the hell out of someone and commented “aw poor c*nt🤣” and received a ban. When I appealed this my appeal was denied. Any time I use the c word or excessive use of any swear word for that matter I receive a ban… whatever happened to freedom of speech? I posted about a known paedophile living in my local area to raise awareness to my community but, you guessed it, the Facebook pedo protectors banned me for “harassment and bullying”?? Yet I receive multiple spam messages per day from fake accounts attempting to scam people and Facebook do nothing about this or the numerous paedophiles that use Facebook to groom kids or even the animal cruelty pictures and videos that are posted on the daily.

I am using this review site to appeal to Facebook to close my Facebook account as I consider that their platform is highly unsafe for account security.

With a very cool leisure area down below called the ‘Rave Cave’ we had plenty to enjoy at night with games and an extensive selection of DVD’s. The food selection and menu planning was diverse and delicious. With a 10 and 14 year old we were unsure we would find something that we all agreed on but we had plenty to delight us and Mark and Martina cooked it beautifully. We were meant to have one night in, but the food was so delicious we decided to stay home.

Facebook,2022-06-19T03:11:23.000Z,1,"Facebook is the world record of “The biggest violation of people privacy, liberty and the worst experience ever”.Basically I only use Facebook because most mobile games use this to sync data between different devices or to create accounts, and I find it ridiculous. And the following must change without questioning.First, it’s almost impossible to create an account. You have about an 1/10 chance to success without extra verification, and “disagreeing” that we didn’t “violate their Community Standards”, while we did absolutely NOTHING wrong, but just trying to create an account. And those extra steps include a PHOTO of our FACE, which some employees will see and use to verify the account, which is unacceptable. This kind of steps must be removed.Second, the primary location, which is not possible to change. And don’t think this is only visible to you. Anyone there working on Facebook can see that like all your stored data on your account. And the fact that this location is impossible to change makes the user experience worse, by providing location-based feeds that don’t interest them, because this is not what they want to see, or it’s not in a language they understand. Living in a country doesn’t mean they can speak *that* language. Two settings must be added: one to change the primary location, the second to use a chosen primary language or country for personal feeds (including ""people you may know"") instead of something location-based.Third, there are tons of useless settings and texts, a lot could be grouped together or just removed, because we are all lost in there and we don’t have time to always check everything. This should really be reviewed.Last, I am often hearing about censoring there in other reviews. Personally I still didn't try to post anything, but this looks very disappointing."

Craig (the owner) doesn’t just sell optical products.  He is knowledgeable in fitting his customers with what THEY need at a price comfortable for them.  I know from experience other optical outlets try to upsell or deal in inferior products, pointing out there opticasl are a cheaper buy.There’s an old adage: “I’m too poor to buy cheap.”  At Tom Stevens you don’t need to worry about buying something inferior only to have to replace it in the near future.  Craig stands behind what he sells and takes the time to explain how to derive maximum benefit (care, etc) for the products he sells.Yes, you can go to a big box store and probably purchase something cheaper.  However, in a short time you’ll regret not having to gone to a professional like Craig at Tom Stevens Optical."
Facebook,2022-06-13T19:43:33.000Z,1,"I've been on Facebook since 2011.  When people used to say that they censored you I thought they were a bit sensitive, but it turns out that isn't the case.  I have been restricted recently due to one of my posts, which my friends' assure me was respectful and contained nothing untoward.  I was unable to discover why, no means of contacting them, as such I can't be sure that I will avoid doing it again.  Now I discover that my business page has been restricted, this time I found help (they're more interested in business obviously), I'm told that something in my 'user and page' was removed due to violating their standards.  I haven't changed what's been written on the page in forever, and I can see nothing in the settings that has been removed.  It makes absolutely no sense.  But this is the real kicker!  No they won't tell me why, no they won't tell me what they removed.  As such, once again, I can't be sure to avoid breaking their rules.  This is affecting my ability to do my job helping people.  Unacceptable, and since when did ANY company have the right to censor without explanation?  There's an option to let Facebook know about the review, frankly I'm not taking that chance!"
Facebook,2022-06-13T18:02:19.000Z,1,"Absolutely disgusting how Facebook make it such an F around to deactivate a profile. Most people who want to temporarily deactivate are going to be having some troubles and need a break, and you make things so much harder for people who probably really don't need this extra BS! I've now been left with my messenger still active and yet can't even get back onto it to deactivate it because it's locked itself!! It doesn't match up with actual Facebook deactivation and now it refuses to let me back on even when i do everything correctly and put code in/confirm email. And the fact that Facebook is uncontactable to sort anything is absolutely DISGUSTING."

Facebook,2022-06-12T04:08:01.000Z,1,"The systematic targeting and violations of the freedom of speech are astounding. Your public criticism of Conservatives, Libertarian and Anti-Federalist groups puts you HARD in the Progreasive Plague that is ruining this country. I'm seriously just about done with monetarily supporting a company that silences those who may speak different, use different types of metaphors to make a point. Your AI algorithm as well as the high-school students you hired to review their findings is, in my opinion... The most absurd part of Facebook. Suckerberg I hope you actually consider a review board. Where a person has a chance to defend their speech or their point. Quit running a dictatorship, we live in a Representative Republic. Where everyone has an equal opportunity to defend themselves against their accuser. Due process... Google it."
Facebook,2022-06-10T22:03:58.000Z,1,"They actually offer PRETEND customer support.  They are completely useless, provide incorrect information over and over again, do not actually respond to anything you say (you'll say, what exactly is the problem with my commerce account because I can't tell, here's a bunch of screenshots) and then they will send you some articles that have no bearing on the issue.  Over and over again.  They'll schedule calls, not call, then send you an email saying you weren't there at the scheduled time, then you say you were and they apologize and offer to pretend to call you again. They are worse than useless because they just pretend to help you, which just wastes a lot of time.  I wouldn't use facebook except it's a monopoly and I have no choice."

Facebook,2022-06-10T16:46:39.000Z,1,Facebook marketplace is a complete scam. I bought a fridge from there which was supposed to work but it didn't. It cost me £120. The seller refused to refund me and blocked me. It shouldn't be allowed to operate without a guarantee.

It affected my new ads agency and I lost a major client because some hacker hacked my account and through that got access to all my client ads accoaunts. After getting on the phone with fb representative they said they are working on the issue and this issue will be resolved in a month. More than 2 months passed and the account has been permanently disabled. They have wasted so much of my time and drained my energy. If your account is hacked they will hold you responsible. They do not care of security and have 0 support. Well bye bye to Facebook and will use other ad platforms like google, bing, TikTok and taboola for all my new clients. And will make sure I tell all my big clients never to trust Facebook with your money. So big company can be so careless I didn’t know that"

There is no way i have searched to work to gain back access to my account. You as a company have been told of my situation and obviously not just me but i do not know how many have been hacked. This is down to you as a company to put measures in place and when someone says they are hacked or scammed then should be an easier fix. but by you not shutting my page down until a fix is done each day the scammer has more time to catch others. then other peoples lives can be ruined in the process. The saddest thing is my family pictures are on there and these are being used as a means of a scam. I can prove this is my page with live videos of my family to which i am sure the other person can never get hold of. how can i get back my facebook now?? nothing is easy as it should be and you cannot speak to anyone in uk facebook to resolve?? Even numbers provided do not work and no actual person on live chat to help fix??"

Yet they allow real hate speech as long as it's done by the left. Needless to say, I closed my account down and will not have anything to do with any Facebook entity at all.

I only hear ""rest assured, internal team is working on the case"". They cannot give a specific timeframe. 6 months passed! Probably they are in financial difficulty and trying to scam their users.

Facebook,2022-06-01T22:03:37.000Z,1,Facebook is discriminating against gay groups. They constantly restrict and remove any gay male group that post pictures of the beauty of men. The process to appeal doesn't work. They restrict with absolutely no recourse what so ever.

Facebook,2022-05-31T16:57:59.000Z,1,"I am a Facebook user and generally I am happy with the  platform. Where i struggle is trying to appeal a decision about a listing being removed. For example, i posted on marketplace my copy of Jimi Hendrix Electric Ladyland. Facebook claimed that the nudes on the cover were in violation, so i removed this and re-listed which was accepted. However, my account was suspended for 30 days and my existing posts will be restricted for 90 days. The mechanism to appeal this decision is virtually non- existent. When you finally get through to someone  you are asked to pay a nominal £1.00 for a technician to review the case. What i object to is having to give your card details.  I am afraid like many American companies they make it difficult to contact them and consistently hide behide Covid for poor service."

Facebook,2022-05-30T10:20:27.000Z,1,racism and discrimination  is everywhere on the platfrom. this platform give birth to hate and supports war.
Facebook,2022-05-30T02:22:56.000Z,1,"As both a business owner and user of Facebook, it is my belief that they care not of decency and basic humanity. I'm not even making this up, they literally reward people who stay on the platform for hours on end, and punish those who do not. So if you happen to have a life where you can't be glued to their platform for hours on end, you're probably experiencing a decline in your reach and engagement on your posts these days. On the opposite end, if you're the type who spends hours on Facebook posting every meal, every life event, and gets lost in Stories, and memes, etc, then it's likely you love Facebook because you're not experiencing the same penalties as those who don't or can't spend that kind of time on the platform. Their extraordinarily strict policies and plethora of algorithms are destroying businesses by the handful. Those who aren't in this category are oblivious to this fact. It's unfortunate that SO many fellow business owners, to include myself, are being restricted and blocked from running Ads, and worse, simply because of errors in their algorithms. My account was restricted for over 6-months (I couldn't run a single Ad), and after multiple requests for review I finally received an email response saying my account was restricted in error and has been restored and ""sorry for the inconvenience"". However, by that time my business was already severely impacted and my Ads never performed the same again (likely because of one or more algorithms perpetually attached to my profile). I found out (from a ""Facebook Ad Expert"") the lack of performance is likely because all my customers and clients and potential leads who were attached to my pixel had fallen off because of the extended time. So I basically had to start from scratch to build that pixel back up. Similarly, my personal account remains restricted because it was never resolved and I was told, also via email (because that's the only support available) there was nothing they could do. All it would take to resolve this issue would be to speak with an ACTUAL PERSON. Since that's not an option with Facebook anymore, unless you happen to be among the elite, an 8-figure or more business owner, honest business owners like myself have to suffer. I'm currently shifting my business model to operate without Facebook, and unless someone with a higher moral conscience than ""Z"" and his fellow billionaire and millionaire executives takes over, I'm done. Let's really think about this for a second: As of the date of this post, Facebook has a total of 11,171 reviews on Trustpilot™. Of those reviews, only 14% of them are 5 stars and 68% of them are 1 star (2, 3, and 4 stars are 5%, 6%, and 7%, respectively). That speaks volumes! Sure, I'll check the little box at the bottom of this text box that says ""Let Facebook know about your review..."" My guess is that I won't ever hear from anyone to discuss resolution and my Facebook accounts will likely be completely shut down in retaliation. Then I'll have to post another 1 star.Prove me wrong Facebook, and I'll change/update my rating. Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before karma bites you in the booty."

It's part of their business model. Move quickly and break things; guess what they're moving quickly and definitely breaking stuff. Our morale. I hate to break it to you all but you're not the customer, you are the product. The people buying all your demographical information are the customers. You are the commodity. As long as you continue to click through things and look at pictures of Russian teenagers grooming their fancy rats. They don't care what sort of experience you have as long as it doesn't cause you to stop. And just like any decent Monopoly, they don't have to worry about you going someplace else. Because they've made sure there is no place else. So you're lucky you get anything at all."

They now have useless algorithms that ban you for no reason. We have appealed this 2 months on they have done  nothing to review it. I was getting 80% referrals on Facebook then 70% on Instagram. Since blocking my personal account I can't control adverts (they still take ad money you can't see what your paying for) pixel for referrals and this is now disconnected from my website. Shopify disconnected it for safety as I can no longer use my FB account. Due to this I'm going to be looking at taking legal action against meta for loss or earnings. Because of their madeup policy I've lost loads of potential orders. They also can't come up with a proper reason for anyone why your blocked. My friend was blocked 2 times and the second was for the reason of the first blocking.  I've now moved over to tictok it's much better and much more user friendly. Without any wokebookers on the apps. My stop has already got me sales on tictok. I shall never recommend anything meta Facebook are involved in to anyone.

Facebook,2022-05-21T22:03:27.000Z,1,"Banned from Facebook for a picture of my granddaughterdaughter at the butterflies exhibit. Facebook claimed that it was child exploitation. A picture of a 7 year old, fully dressed in a public place at a butterfly exhibit. And yet Facebook algorithm has decided that a picture of my own granddaughter on my Facebook page is inappropriate. With no way to contact the powers that be at Facebook it seems their decision is unilateral without regard of a defense. They have no phone number,email address, chat, or snail mail to contact them in regards to this issue or any other. With so many growing dissatisfied with Facebook, you would think they would want to retain the ones who are still with them. Apparently they do not value those who use their site."

Facebook,2022-05-19T19:23:03.000Z,3,"I am not setting Facebook down because as far as I am concern,  what you get free as a consumer you can take or leave.   So I give them still a medium critic. However, I hope someone from the company is overlooking critics and perhaps it will help to solve some of the now arriving  problems. Since Facebook has taken over other social media the advertising appears to be getting out of hand.  OK,  again, if you get something for free, someone has to pay for it.  In cases like Facebook and a few other social media the free page is produced through advertising.  Here is what is critical if it comes to advertising that actually is ruining the freedom of my so called profile wall.  When I   go shopping I don't have to enter stores I don't want.  If I get commercial at home, I can shut them down.  Facebook  has an option to remove the advertising you don't like.  But for every removal, Facebook will give you 2 fresh once  back to clutter my news feed.  Before, I was  able to choose my own subjects.  Now, they just put them in my news feed even if I  have just turned one of the same type off.   Facebook, please return to your old ways and let us choose what we like to see.  Don't push garbage and spam on your members.  Privacy law in groups or on your profile gets violated by Facebook more than enough right now.  Yes, Facebook violates our rights  to freedom of speech. (clean speech)  I host a few genealogy groups and lately,  when ever I post something that includes War, American Soldiers and historical facts,  Facebook removes it with the announcement of violation of the Facebook standart.   I had to  go after them in a few cases,  because I am very careful what I post and I don't post against their standard because I post with common sense.     Facebook, it is time to learn your history before you act out of control. Last thing on my critic list is the fact that I get posts from friends that use   pre-written posters from people or  companies that should not be able to post at all.   I grew up in a home without foul language.   Or as we called it ""Street language.""  I feel that everybody can do what they want to do.  However, when I open up my facebook in the morning and find already posters with a head line that goes deep into street language,  I feel that I don't even want to be on Facebook anymore.  if I don't want to see it I need to turn it off and in many ways I am not sure why people are allowed to post this in the first place since many Post have the type of language that is supposed to be against Facebook's policy. The title often alone is in violation of Facebook's standard,  but people still post it because they think some of the stuff is cool.  I have to admit,  that not everything is what the title says.   But often the title comes across as disrespect toward your friends.  Here, censorship of speech should be used.  Facebook, watch what you let into your door with ready made posters.   I would not be a Facebook user anymore if I wouldn't have committed myself to help others with their genealogy and  to keep in contact with family members.   However, I keep my promises even if I feel offended almost every day.  It is getting  harder to be helpful with so much uncensored filth that is coming up on Facebook now. Facebook, would  you please take care of that?  Thank you."
Facebook,2022-05-19T17:04:39.000Z,1,"I was a Facebook user for over 10 years and after all these years I can definitely say that people shouldn't use this platform and everyone that is using it should leave it as soon as possible. Why? Because they're unreliable. I had my first account ""temporary locked"" because I changed my profile photo to some meme. I sent them my ID and they still didn't unlock my account.Made a second account with my real name (just like the first one) and didn't had major problems until in 2019 - 2020 when they decided to lock some of my account facilities like commenting, liking posts not only once but many, many times just because apparently some of the comments I write way back doesn't conform to their ""community standards"" saying that I harrassed or intimidate people when all I did was, for example to just say that someone was ugly. Sure, it's not a nice thing to say but I hardly doubt that this can be considered as ""harassment and intimidation"".And using this excuse they crippled my account many times.Also they have no support, no contact e-mail, no phone, no live chat, no web form, nothing that resembles any kind of support.If your account is ""temporarily locked"" and you can't login in your account, if functionality of your account is suspended for a month, if your account gets hacked there's absolutely no way to contact support if their support even exists in the first place.If you have a Facebook account please mark it for deletion and stop using it all together.There's absolutely no point in using such unreliable social media."
Facebook,2022-05-19T13:10:53.000Z,1,"Facebook customer service is TERRIBLE!I am shocked how Facebook continues to make their customer service from bad to terrible. Now and again, I come back and give their advertising platform another chance.To my amazement, they now block me in my group. I pay them to bring me leads, and the leads CHOOSE TO JOIN MY FACEBOOK GROUP. I post two times a day during a five-day challenge and tag the members so they can engage with the post. Facebook blocked me from engaging in my group for the first three days of the challenge and then daily for the next two days. I extended the challenge due to being blocked daily and not being able to tag the members in my post. Meanwhile, I am getting emails daily from strangers trying to sell me illegal services. Facebook has the algorithm to stop me from doing my job, but not for unlawful business to be conducted.When I ask for any refund or reimbursement, I am told that Facebook does not do that. They have no problem taking 1,500 euros from my account but seem to lack the ability to refund their mistakes.I have never been happier to LEAVE FACEBOOK once and for all. I will take my money and business elsewhere."

Apparently, my account was hacked and now FB says it does not meet Community Standards.  There is NO WAY to contact FB support other than to challenge the locking of my account.  Since I have proof of unauthorized logins and have not posted in FB for weeks, it disappoints me that there is no one to try to resolve this with.  No phone or chat support and apparently no email support.  With millions of people using FB, one would think they would have someone/some way to work through issues like this.  I saw hundreds of complaints on the BBB site, many similar to mine.  Facebook support is a joke – it does not exist.  I would not even care, but I am missing out on photos and updates from family.

Facebook,2022-05-11T09:59:30.000Z,1,"Facebook Marketplace claims they pay sellers within 5 days from the date buyers receive their merchandise.  However, this is further than the truth. I've waited weeks to get paid and when I do, it's NEVER the amount that is due to me. They pay sellers in spurts -meaning,  if they owe you $100, you may get $15 of that in weeks.. not 5 days as they claim. HERE IS THE BIGGEST SCAM: When you finally do get someone via email and ask where your money is, they'll sometimes say your money was deposited into your bank on a specific date. When you call the bank to verify, the bank will tell you they never received any deposits from Facebook.  Yes, this happened several times including today with me. After today, I have finally had enough and will not ever trust or sell on Facebook Marketplace. If you do sell... good luck! Better keep track of all your order numbers. But even with that... you still going to have problems getting paid... or getting paid on time."

I got hacked 7 WEEKS ago and I have sent 4 IDs and tried over 20 TIMES to get back in LEGITIMATELY!!!!!!!!!!STILL waiting.....BUT, I miss it and my 4,000+ friends, because OTHERWISE, I find it WONDERFUL."
Facebook,2022-05-07T20:01:02.000Z,1,"Like many others here, my Instagram account (that’s linked to my Facebook account) has been disabled for absolutely no reason but “Meta” claimed that it’s because I violated their terms which I did no such thing. I woke up one day and got a popup asking me to verify my phone number, so I did and enter a code they sent me then BAM, my account was locked out and they told me to wait 24 hours.First, let me start by saying I NEVER had issues with Facebook or Instagram. They’re collecting data and learning from me as a cost for me using their platform and I’ve accept that. I accepted their changes, their consistent pushy ads, their bugs, glitches, and everything else. But this is going TOO FAR. I’ve read on so many places online, app reviews, Reddit posts where many people have also gotten their Instagram or Facebook account suspended for no reason.Keep in mind, I’m a very average user who shares my creative content (nothing with violence, nudity, or anything offensive). I’m the most average Instagram user that uses the platform to keep up with artists, following many awesome pages and to have group conversations with friends and family.Secondly, this is atrociously irresponsible of Meta/IG/FB to suspend accounts just because they programmed some bot that mistakenly flags people for innocent things or for no reason at all (in my case). They disable accounts instantly with no warning but yet with all the data they collected, all the money they make from ad spend, marketing and transactions, they can’t have at least ONE call center with humans to look through these cases and reactivate accounts which takes probably a click of a button?!?!! They literally don’t care about their user-base or community whether you pay them or not hence why customer support is a foreign concept to them!Thirdly, I’ve tried submitting numerous forms for weeks. I’ve submitted humiliating photos of myself holding up a handwritten sign per their instructions at least 7 times and submitted my ID to them 3 times only to be ignored over and over again.I’m flipping infuriated right now and I’ve heard this happen to people in the past. I never thought it would happen to me but since it happened, I’ve been nothing but angry. I feel like a portion of my social life has been robbed from me. Many people reading this might think that’s over exaggeration but I’m in my early 30s, I’m introverted and I have a lot of mental burden I’m dealing with. Sharing and posting on IG and connecting with other artists around the world was my way to cope. I’ve lost it all in a blink of an eye! I cannot create a new account because I don't have a separate phone number or email that i could use since my contact details are still connected to the disabled account. Also, making a new account and trying to regain all my data from the past 12 years manually is just too much work!FYI: There's scammers and spammers everywhere on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media with people claiming they could hack and get your account back. These jerks are spamming this everywhere, trying to mislead people into thinking they can retrieve accounts. Then, there's others who ""know people at IG"" and try to charge thousands for getting accounts reactivated for you. IG claims they don't allow this but if they can't even help us, why would they care about their employees extorting users?! I cannot believe this has been an on-going problem for so long and IG just brushed it away. How do we know these people who work at IG aren't the ones disabling accounts and then extorting users to pay for it back?!"

Facebook,2022-05-02T17:43:36.000Z,1,"I have just endured four months of a miserable experience trying to utilise Facebook advertising. The methods are overly complicated/difficult to manage and the ads manager is the most overblown, inutile system I have ever come across, focusing on all the wrong things and offering nothing that is genuinely useful - BUT - the advertising 'does' actually work. The problem is, due to the aforementioned problems, the system starts off adverts without authorisation, it duplicates adverts and it charges both daily and monthly, once a limit is reached, but at the same time, it is almost impossible to review the adverts and trace the problem. One wrong move, one keystroke - and you have started an advert off, which can be difficult to stop. Worse than that, when you eventually manage to navigate the rats maze that is the procedure for communicating with this communications company, they absolutely refuse to admit error. Fighting to win back refunds for overcharging is SO time consuming that it negates the benefit of advertising at all. This service is terrible and its failings far outweigh the gain. Avoid it like the plague."

The Constitution and the Human Rights are just sand thrown in fools' eyes. Everything is censured, so the others cannot have access to the truth. The same happened many times before with simple pictures I posted. I deleted my first account one year ago. I made another one, thinking to give it another chance. But things got worse. Facebook also record any movement you make, including the hours when you log in and log off, your IP which link if clicked goes directly to your internet provider, the brand of your computer/phone you use to log in, all the comments you post, all people/pages/groups you follow, etc. And if you want to delete some of the comments you posted, good luck to you; for it will take hours, as you have just the option to delete them one by one, and not in bulk. As their NWO agenda will be implemented, there will be massive arrests of the dissidents, the ones who will be against their criminal agenda. This is happening on all social media platforms, more or less. But I didn't feel safe on Facebook in last year, and tonight I just got the last evidence of how they control and censure our right to free speech. I will choose to stay away from any social media platform from now on. It is the safest way to be."

As long as you are targeting people of color your page is safe. On man posted “ let’s go out and kill all the little bigger children”, while a white woman posts about who should be exterminated. Horrible people are behind that platform"

It's difficult to work out if the management team are too greedy, too stupid or they just don't care about their customers... maybe all of the above."

Facebook,2022-04-20T11:13:50.142Z,1,"Facebook has been very unfair. I responded to the commenter who provoked people in my country, who made hateful comments, mocked the country and people of my country, adversely affecting the image of the country. my country in the eyes of world friends. Why do they comment in violation but they are not banned? Facebook bans very bull.sh.it and biased stuff. I hate facebook more and more, I use it only for communication and entertainment purposes. But facebook makes me extremely annoyed with malicious trash news that provokes outrage among users, I consider quitting facebook soon if facebook does not improve in the future. The Facebook experience is extremely poor. Facebook even allows terrorists to use this platform to attack Russia. Why just for a petty matter of a reactionary ban unreasonable users? Those who react and betray the country deserve to be treated like this. Your human rights and community standards are fake."
Facebook,2022-04-20T08:51:33.722Z,1,"Not only has Facebook made sure that nobody can get any customer service help for facebook it self they, after purchasing Instagram, have taken that platform and taken away their customer service. It seems like anything they acquire turns to immediately to the same incompetent customer service they provide with all their other ventures. After having an account for years on Instagram, before they got purchased by FB, now they claim I have violated their terms. All I do is post my photos and my account is private. I have tried to contact them for the past few months and other than a generic computer generated response, nobody has ever gotten back to me. I finally understand why more and more people are looking for a substitute for anything that is not owned by the FB group as they seem to only care about your data and personal info so they can sell it to the highest bidder. They are essentially a hacking company gathering your personal information for their own personal gain. We need a new social media platform that has better customer service and doesn't sell your private data, they know more about you than you do. Don't bother with them. Looking for a better option, any suggestions?"

I am Facebook user since the beginning of facebooks existence and I am so disappointed. I am mother, nurse and I mostly post food recipes and post with cultural recommendations. There’s absolutely no way to reach Facebook and have them research if my account has been hacked. I find it a bit scary and irresponsible of Facebook. It says on my closed profile that I’ve posted an offensive post with childporn😳🥲 I am shocked! The message from Facebook is that it’s been to long time and they now won’t open my account, even though I have no idea what happened - seriously? On top of that the same day of the deactivation my Visacard was hacked and US dollars was withdrawn from my account.

This has happened a few times already, so its clear the moderators are fine with racism, and enjoy banning people of colour for some reason. Its ok for the white guy to be rude and say bad stuff but if i do it i get banned, because the racist guy couldnt handle the heat and reported me.

I've tried everything in the hope I can gain access again as my buisness page was also linked to it and I had tons of photos of my son. The hacker managed to somehow make 7 transactions from my bank account and setting up a continuous direct debit. Luckily the bank have refunded and are reviewing it.I then made a new account which I have now also been banned from because I apparently have multiple accounts.

When i clicked on forgot password I was told they would send details to an unknown email. Once the person had got into my account they just changed the email and locked me out. There was no way to get back in and no way to contact facebook. I found various emails and wrote to them, never heard anything back. Called a number i found but they no longer take calls.Mean while the scammer contacted all my contacts pretending to be me and asking for money. Thus my friends no longer trust me and I am left with no account.

In my opinion, it's time for everyone to leave facebook, even going back to myspace would be much better. You still have the same options and all, so why not. twitter, instagram, etc. has limited usage and capabilities. I strong suggest moving away from facebook, especially since they are insisting on breaking the laws that you have rights to have under the constitution. Thank you"

Facebook NEEDs to be shut down, it needs to held accountable to anti monopoly laws. The sale and acquisition of both instagram and whatsapp were completely unjustified. Especially considering as they both function as social media platforms. Whatsapp alows stories nowadays and Instagram is essentially identical to facebook since facebook has decided to story features as well as ""reels"". Facebook is completely corrupt, it disregards their users by distributing their data for profit. they allow third party applications to manipulate facebook at basically zero consequence. Putting user identifications, names, personal data as well as credit information widely public for every body. Facebook cares very little about the data that is leaked from facebook because it sells that data to basically nyone anyways. Heard of cainbridge analytica? Facebook is literally responsible for the political destabilization in both great nations and minor nations. Facebook is a virus that we willingly download on to our own computers and phones. It listens to our conversations, it takes pictures of us when ever it pleases. It is the AI that is going to destroy us like in the movie terminator. I'm quite literally at risk writing this.

Facebook,2022-02-18T23:39:33.000Z,1,"Be very careful with what you post and send in messenger. My sister's account was hacked. Someone kicked her out and took over her account. Access to cards, messages, and everything. Even though many (over 15) friends have reported the account, facebook just keeps telling people to block her. She luckly canceled her cards and most of our friends know. Honestly, I don't know how it is legal for facebook to keep ignoring this. I will definitely not be using it like, I was!"
Facebook,2022-02-18T14:58:34.000Z,1,This is getting out of hand now. Facebook has blocked my account 4 or 5 times now since January for commenting on and talking to a monkey. They say it was bullying and threatening. That’s a load of crap because I was the only one that committed in the first place and I was talking to the momma monkey for abusing her newborn baby monkey. They will not let you talk to anyone and good luck trying to get ahold of someone. They discriminate against some people and they hide from them so the people who’s account got blocked can’t even defend them selfs. Now I see why Mark has been sued numerous times.

Even in your own PRIVATE groups, you can't post the stuff you want without getting zucced. The left took over and ruined it all with their woke bs.

I didn't post anything, I didn't add anyone, I didn't write any comments, and in fact I haven't even gone on the platform in quite some time. Despite all this, my account has been disabled FOUR TIMES for supposedly ""violating the community standards"". And somehow I've been on instagram for nearly a year and NEVER ONCE had this problem. Honestly as soon as it gets re-enabled again I'm just deleting my account because I'm sick of dealing with this"

Facebook,2022-02-10T00:17:51.000Z,1,Facebook purposely do things to keep non Caucasian off their platform. Any time a Caucasian report something you say Facebook finds it goes against community standards. My account was suspended because I said someone was hilarious and typical. How is that bullying? They make sure to protect the fragile ego of Caucasians that fully participate in a conversation but when African Americans report racism or bullying it never goes against community standards
Facebook,2022-02-09T16:04:10.000Z,1,I have been marketing on Facebook for years. Then all of a sudden my account gets locked but it want say why or explain how to unlock it.

Facebook,2022-02-09T14:19:37.000Z,1,Facebook-meta shouldn’t even receive a star. Facebook-Meta should be removed from the internet like they are doing to others that aren’t doing anything wrong. I’m an Active fisherman They deactivated my account for a photo post of a lake trout in my sink. Stating it’s animal abuse. How is cleaning/prepping dinner animal abuse? They also deactivated another account I made because I posted a photo of my 3 year old son holding A fish that he caught ice fishing their reason for deactivation was once again animal abuse. then I made another and they deactivated it because I had two accounts. Go figure. it is very poor for a social media network to try to politically control others to try and buddy up with the government. I now don’t have Facebook and it’s more difficult to keep in touch with my family and friends who only communicate on The social media network. But I have found other ways to communicate with out someone interfering with my personal life and trying to control everything I say or do. I HOPE FACEBOOK IS DEACTIVATED. The same way they are treating other good hard working tax paying citizens of this country.  Please someone start a new platform for all to join and leave the political control and personal information stealing out of it. The funny part is that meta is deactivating all these accounts so the people will make new accounts so metas new account activation status-value will go up and they can make more money in the stocks. They are playing the system. Then complaining they lost so much money from stocks dropping . I hope they go broke and be a point of the passed like yahoo messenger and MySpace but at least yahoo and MySpace did not infringe on your constitutional rights!!!!’ Zuckerberg get yourself together or use the door we the people are sick and tired of it.

They don't like Christians of the paler skinned kind, and if they had their way we would all be burned to the stake by that CGI looking overlord, Suckerberk."
Facebook,2022-01-28T14:16:11.000Z,1,"Two days' ban from the Facebook police because I said an evil person should be hung by their own entrails for injuring a horse so badly, she lost both eyes! Thankfully, the beautiful girl has found a loving, forever home, which I also mentioned. What is wrong with these people? So much for free speech! Honestly, you see far, FAR worse posted, but it seems to be acceptable. What does it say about their staff?"
Facebook,2022-01-28T10:18:12.000Z,1,"It used to be a good site ten years ago but nowadays it's truly dreadful and I hope one day it closes down. You get banned for saying things which don't actually violate any Facebook rules and bullying is allowed a lot of the time. One woman told me to get Cancer and die and I reported her and Facebook said it was perfectly acceptable what she said. I called her disgusting and Facebook banned me and actually deleted my account completely. Bullying on Facebook is a truly staggering problem, plus now you can't actually get through to any customer service staff you can only leave site feedback so Facebook don't want to know if you need any help. Even if you click on the help function it actually does nothing more than leave feedback. People can report you for disagreeing with them too and Facebook can ban you for bullying for simply disagreeing. I was banned earlier this year for saying ""sorry I don't agree with that"", the woman became furious that I disagreed and reported me and Facebook banned me. I'd say Facebook isn't a site anyone should use nowadays and society needs to go back to how it was before the internet, advertise for friendss or love in the newspapers or in chip shops. Real life meet up groups, get each other other's phone numbers and be real friends not virtual friends. Depression, obesity, suicides etc...all higher now than before social networkign and social media was created, why? Because there used to be real life social meet groups and people used to go out meeting new people and that  helped. Now people sit at home doing nothing and feel lonely and the suicide rate has doubled. Facebook has damaged society and that's been proven too by doctors and psychiatrists."
Facebook,2022-01-27T22:36:21.000Z,1,"Hate their customer service. They either take awhile or don't do anything to help. They are also sensitive or let the sensitive whiney babies get their way like other companies. My mom posted a comment about snakes because she hates them. She put ""shoot them"" and they restricted her account twice because of that. That is bullcrap. I've seen so many bullies on facebook, scammers and just some nasty people. Those are the people that deserve to be restricted or in facebook jail. Facebook also is all about their beliefs with the president and covid. If you don't like it they treat you different.

Facebook,2022-01-15T13:47:20.000Z,1,"Beware of buying anything on Facebook Marketplace as it provides a platform for fraudsters and scammers.  I was scammed a few days ago for a small amount of money by a seller who was marketing very popular items for  very low prices - e.g. Genuine Apple iPhone USV-C chargers and cables for about half price.  I lost £24 which is not a great deal but the scammer is probably selling hundreds of these every day - money was transferred into his bank account and I did not receive the goods and he is not responding to my many messages.  He is selling under the name Rizwaan Hussain, London but his facebook account appears to be very recently opened and is likely to be a temporary account. I contacted the National Fraud Unit, my bank and the bank where the fraudster asked for  payment to be transferred to (Metro Bank  London - sort code 23-05-80 A/c Number 14196056).  However, my guess  is that the fraudster has opened the bank account using a false identity.  The worst problem is there is no facility to contact Facebook or Marketplace to report the fraudster - no phone number, no email address - nothing but an online facility to report problems.  However when issue is reported online their advise is to block the seller!!!  They simply do not care."
Facebook,2022-01-15T09:55:00.000Z,1,"Facebook is a gaslighting propaganda platform for the globalist elite.They censor political content they do not like and favor content of leftists and lying Democrat politicians. Facebook will punish page owners for ambiguous reasons and will not specify why. Facebook loves to tell people they are bad and punish them for doing what Facebook allows them to do.They use ""opinions"" from fact checkers to mark information so it appears to be false. Fact checkers will spin true information anyway they can to mark it with a fact check. If you believe Facebook Fact Checkers are independent, unbiased organizations, you have lost all sense of reality. Fact checkers will frequently mark memes, that appears similar to another ones, as false information when they are not the same as the memes with the false information on them. The only recourse is to email the fact checker for correction. The fact checkers ignore emails.I know people who needed to have their attorney send letters to fact checkers to get their false claims and spins removed from their post. Facebook treats publications and other businesses more like adversaries than anything. If you don't like you, they will remove all of your advertising from your own business page and groups and call it ""spam."" How can you spam your own business page and groups?Stay away from Facebook. Having an account on Facebook is only helping to feed their massive gaslighting and censorship campaign against the public."

I spent 2 years building an Instagram account from scratch, it recently was stolen in a hack and is posting bitcoin posts. The security is easily bypassed. There is NO response from Facebook/META and there is no place to contact Instagram.  Except for one USA based phoneline.  I have reported the hacked account dozens of times, reported the scam bitcoin posts. Reported it on the only form available on META/FB 'Report a bug"".  I've replied to the Google mail sent regarding the suspicious activity. I have asked others to report the account. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING F4OM INSTAGRAM. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Meanwhile my carefully gathered and nurtured contacts are being inundated with BITCOIN SPAM.Lack of Security and support has left me extremely vulnerable. The hacker knows exactly who I communicate with via message. Has as many personal details as is on my account . Within one minute a phone no. Apparently from Nigeria +2349085451773 took over my account,  changed the name, from PoetLoui to Poetloui55 they changed the  email and added an app to protect the NEW USER. All in under 1 minute.I received emails from Google that suspicious activity occurred on my Instagram, but all links to secure the account were useless/invalid as the account name,  everything,  was changed so quickly. Instagram has absolutely no point of support for me to communicate with in the UK. Or anywhere.When you Google ' my Instagram account was hacked it says to change the email address  BUT THATS ALREADY BEEN DONE! The ONLY advice ANYONE had is to contact further online hackers who can retrieve your account for a cost. WHAT A CON!AND INSTAGRAM AND FB OR Meta now, suppress all your natural traffic to your page , add shadow banning and STILL expect you to PAY for advertising and increased traffic. DO NOT BOTHER WITH A FB/META/INSTAGRAM account unless you want to lose your intellectual property and ALL your personal details.This is a disgusting  immoral,  money grabbing exercise in your own pointless endeavours DO NOT BOTHER.DO NOT GIVE THESE SOCIAL MEDIA CRIMINALS ANY OF YOUR DATA.

I read Facebook's Community Standards and it includes the following: DIGNITYWe believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights.

The issue was that after the information was processed,  it took me right back to the cookies page for me to log in and do the verification yet again. It's a continuous cycle and I've got over 5 email verifications and 10 mobile security codes to prove them. Its ridiculous for a billion dollar company to have over a billion users in itself to not have a customer service page, hackers to still access your account and pretend to be you, showing child pornography and terrorism videos, but yes my account can be removed for telling a racist tossers to shut up.

For some reason Facebook has decided I am interested in young ladies in scanty attire and they feed me a steady stream of suggestive ""Sponsored Ads"" featuring women often in suggestive poses in lingerie or in bikinis. I have never indicated any interest in woman's lingerie. I have expressed political opinions. I have posted hundreds of photos of the beautiful area in which my wife and I live. And mostly I keep in touch with friends. I have selected every offensive add and said Hide this Ad. But for a year or more this has not let up. I have filed at least 10 complaints in the Help section, accompanied by screen shots of hundreds of these ads. Not one word from Facebook. And the smutty ads keep coming non-stop.I wrote to Facebook in their California headquarters and received no response. This is not funny, and it is not appreciated. If anybody at Facebook is interested (why do I sincerely doubt this) I will be more than happy to send them the several hundred screen shots I have taken of these ads.But Facebook is only concerned with making obscene amounts of money and could really care less about their members. I spend less and less time there and were it not for keeping in touch with friends around the country I would just close the account and tell Facebook to go to hell."

All because I got a job from somebody on marketplace...Now I didn't know the rules at the time.A year later I'm trying to be an affiliate marketer. Facebook is clear that you can sell on facebook.So on my new page I researched how to I could sale on facebook. It clearly says to join groups getting through groups. So I started joining groups and I tried to create my own group last night and they shut me out again. And I was following their rules. The problem is is the communication and not being able to speak to someone to get your side of the story. Maybe if you would just speak to someone and explain to them what is going on.

In that period I got an information that they have started the refund, questions is the refund visible on my account.

I bought a MacBook Air from someone on Facebook marketplace 3 years ago and paid for the item and didn’t receive it. Went through the trouble of getting to know the person, or so I thought, telling them I needed the laptop for work and that I was using the money that my mum left me when she died to get it. Also, they sent me their ID, again or so I thought. After waiting a couple of weeks and not receiving the item, Despite being told at time of paying them that they were standing in the post office waiting for payment. I paid and……nothing. They stopped responding to my messages and calls! I took it to Facebook for them to look into and after some digging myself, I was told by people on Facebook that this person has used someone else’s ID before and conned other people. So my question is, Why has it taken 3 years of me chasing you, only to see I’ve not yet had a resolution! I want my money back! Wether it’s from the person who robbed me from your platform or wether it’s from you, Either way I want my £450 back, Otherwise I am NOT waiting any longer and suing you!!"

Facebook,2021-12-02T14:11:03.000Z,1,Facebook is horrible when your account gets hacked. They don't help at all.
Facebook,2021-12-02T13:40:31.000Z,1,I have been with Facebook since 2008. Very recently I had loads of friend request about 100 or more a day plus loads of likes from these so called people before sending a friend request they also sent loads of messages on messenger as well. I was concerned even though most of my security says who sees it on Facebook only me. And know one can see my friend list only me. I was concerned for my security so I began to delete many friends who I had as friends that I did not know to well who had sent me request through friends of friends. I then had to block some of them as well. At no point did face book flag it up or ask if anything was wrong. I even let Facebook know I may have been hacked so I went through the security with them set up a new pass word and thought great Facebook has now sorted this. To my horror everything was the same loads more friend requests it seemed like friends were being added to my friends that I had not accepted why did my account say there were so many friends when I did not have the amount it stated someone must be doing something. I heard nothing more from Facebook so was worried and began to try to delete more of the friends that were added to my account without my knowledge I also delete every friend request. It was then out of the blue bang Facebook just locked my account how awful is that. All I got was a message telling me my account had been locked due to suspicious activity. Had Facebook picked up on this sooner and recognised what was happening and protected my account it would not have to have been blocked. I have sent photo of ID they requested and now I have been to told to wait for an email they will send to tell me what to do next I have been waiting 40 hours so far. I scheduled a room on the Facebook rooms for this Sunday like I do every week now what will I do. I can’t get on any of my groups or pages I have up on Facebook either it’s a nightmare. There should be more help and support offered and more personal messages sent so we know what’s happening. It is a shame I am being penalised for something that is not my fault come on Facebook please sort this out I can not even get on to messenger very dissatisfied with you sadly 🥵😡 It’s now three days and I am still waiting what are you doing about it Facebook are you doing anything just wondering !!!😡😡 further update it’s now Sunday I was locked out on Tuesday. I was asked for ID I sent my driving licence ID and heard no more only that it would take 48 hours because it took so long I sent it again then an email came back saying this can’t be excepted we need another form of ID so I sent my passport details had another message saying we can accept this ID. I then sent my wedding certificate and have heard nothing since. I can not believe this and how you are treated three forms of ID I have sent. Also being locked out of my account in the first place because I was trying to protect myself from all the friend requests deleting them why wasn’t Facebook protecting me and my account in the first place come on Facebook sort this out you have enough forms of ID now now please unlock my account 😫🥵❤️‍🩹😡😭

Don’t get me wrong it not my only means of contact but it nice to have everyone in one place.  I also love music and started a group on Facebook, there were over 60 members and it was running for about two years, there were a few problems regarding things not working properly in the group, I spent hours trying to figure out why, I won’t go into detail but I contacted Facebook a few times asking for help, I did not get any reply.  I decided to make another group in the hope it would fix the issues, the most unbelievable thing happened, I was booted out of Facebook and asked to provide a photo of my driving licence and passport in order to prove who I was, yeah, rite, not in this lifetime Facebook.  In the end I sent a pic of my library card and a council tax bill, they refused to accept these, I then decided to just open a new account and start from scratch, I did so and made a header pic, posted a photo both just landscape pics as a temp measure, I then started a new group for music and then tried to find all the friends I had just lost, I added some 20 to 30 people out of my over 300 friend list ……I was booted out again and Farcebook then demanded I send a full face picture of myself as proof of who I was."

Sent !!! 5 !!! letters with identity card. YES, there is a small nuance - I use a pseudonym EVERYWHERE. The data of the passport and account do not match when checking, BUT FACEBOOK did not bother with the fact that the card on which the account was originally registered was my real data, WHICH I SENT. ALL PHOTOS ON THE ACCOUNT ARE ALSO MY - and this does not bother anyone either.What we have: a Facebook page that hasn't had a single hacking notification, AND the scammers who are now sitting on my page with my photos and my confidential data and, INCLUDING DEBTS, are buying some advertisements.YOU ARE REAL FRUIT. WHY DO I CONNECT MY PHONE AND E-MAIL TO SOCIAL NETWORKS IF WHO CAN EASILY CHANGE THIS DATA?Russian VKontakte is harder to hack (and easier for owners to recover) than your accounts, DON'T LOOK AT THAT YOU EXIST MUCH MORE. HOW MUCH WITH YOUR FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM (one of the working pages, which I have not yet been restored).I am more and more convinced that the vast majority of American private companies are ABSOLUTELY UNPROFESSIONAL and they absolutely do not care about all the personal information that we trust you.IF YOU REQUIRE VALID DATA WHEN restoring your accounts, DO NOT ALLOW registering these accounts WITHOUT PERSONAL VERIFICATION.Would you say ""it was written in the terms of use to use real data""? YES?? Everywhere you have it is written that you have ONE OF THE BEST SECURITY SYSTEMS ... except that account holders cannot log into their account - BUT FRAUDERS GO IN AND CHANGE THE DATA - EASY. WHERE IS YOUR PROTECTION? Or requiring conditions - we can do this, AND WHEN YOU REQUIRE THE PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA - then immediately ""we cannot help you.IF SOMEONE was faced with the question to open this social network or not - DO NOT.

I was then asked to upload a picture of my ID in order to appeal the ban, this was then also denied with no other options. I even uploaded my ID to Facebook it self and Facebook for developers where it was accepted.I contacted customer support who said I'm banned for a policy violation, which they could not tell me. I wasn't even using Facebook ads during the time it was banned. I have a call arranged but might as well save my self time and ignore it as I'm sure I'll get told the same thing again. This isn't the first time I have had issues with Facebook, they charged twice for an ads invoice once and then their customer support team went on to tell me I was lying and ""that's not what happened though was it"", until I finally got on the phone to them and oh guess what I was charged twice after having useless customer support agents. If you want to use Facebook as a business tool it is good when it works for targeting customers. But as soon as something goes wrong, get ready to be stressed, frustrated and disappointed, because they're completely useless at sorting things. If you are reading this and have been randomly banned, just shut your business down and get a part time job and have a comfortable peaceful life , its not worth the hassle trying to talk to these useless c**ts."

Judge, jury, and executioner to silence individuals and it is often wrong. I am tired of being ""reported"" by the bots for using strongly worded comments, or for memes posted over 5 years before that may be in bad taste but definitely do not go against guidelines. No foul language, or hate speech in either example, but comments are often just standing up for others when users are being hateful themselves (latest is a user laughing at a man using makeup in his 'how-to' videos calling him a kid using clown makeup, and me telling her she could benefit from watching them to even out the paleness of her face against her neck and arms, and to wear bangs to hide her big forehead)... Facebook says MY comment was bullying HER. So Facebook is monitoring EVERYTHING we type or post and their computers have full control to decide if we will be allowed to continue. No grace period to have a human check into our disagreement with fb decisions. This is the final straw. The system won't allow me to post for 24 hours. I'm done. I will be saving my pictures and then I'm done with that social media platform. I do hope they go down with their latest whistleblower issue, and I hope very much that they end up like the other ghosts of social media."

It's such a pity they are a monopoly and control instagram and many other good services. Have spent 7 months trying to reclaim my commerce account to run ads and scale my business. What's worse is the shop on instagram works perfectly while Facebook itself refuses to update or reflect any changes. Contacted customer service over a span of 7 months because my account was restricted incorrectly by the system due to the fact there was no ""profile picture' despite the fact my account had my passport ID linked and was fully verified with my number and 2FA. Customer service was useless and from liaison with the technical team the automatic moderator system flagged it which led to it's restriction. They sympathized but because facebook is controlled by lizards and AI there is no support available for customers.I can't run ads anymore, for my business which is a clothing store.... And neither can I connect to my instagram page, which was setup before Facebook bought instagram. Their interface is also outdated and the commerce manager is full of bugs and issues. Sent many feedback forms to them about it but no response because they simply do not care about small businesses.Seriously poor company and service."

Among other educational couese on the blockchain. She had the best in the business pulling for her Ivan on Tech wrote about her. Iwan Spillebeen talked about her and followed waiting for her to launch I was going to invest my own seed money and her husband told me they couldn't take it . I ask them why ? He said this platform will never launch two and a half years ago and they started in 2017 He explained to me that the censorship of their platform and the ways things are going with the algorithms and the fact he was and activist for children that Facebook had them blocked so bad on all angles that he would never be able to out do them. The found a total of five years. 2 .5 years ago he told me everyone of the moves facebook would make . He even showed me on tor oninion where they were creating post teaching people how to groom and trafficked children and that he could not take my  money ot let me be part of that because he had kids himself he would fight them alone. I follow him and he has been kicked off reedit so many time the almost banned all of Mexico so he could join them again, He has someone come and see him and they went through all of linked in and Facebook and twitter and reedit in linked in alone on his wife account they found 110 fake accounts directly limned to Facebook . All of her friends were fake . He told me almost to the day and called the elections telling the American how rigged they were almost a year before it happen. He has a list of over 200 non profits and over 1000 trump and Biden groups all ran bye people using bots and memes to keep the weak minded he said watching the show while prepare for the biggest crimes against humanity there ever has been Bigger then the holocausts. Almost to the day he called Canada's election how it would happen.  , The same as the American elections A few days ago i found him om a blog where he posted everyone of the donations from the gates foundation to over 8000 universities in the united states to BLM to hospital and the who and cdc . UF schools that have more money then God then  he showed me the most damaging info The Proof that everyone of the media even info wars fox news and all have taken bribes from the Bill Gates foundation. I ask why would they do this ? He said the 33rd president of the United States Truman , Obama book was not about his father It was about his fathers friend and that Truman with the strongest Klan ties even outed back them with a poster that said vote Dewey kill the Klan that Obama using the mentality of a klans man wanted to do as Truman and rid the world of the one s that cost us the most money the African Americans and that is why Truman formed the CIA and the UN at the very time he did that the world changed for every. That Vietnam north nd south were fine until the CIA set tower and office in each side and instigated a war the same as they did in Benghazi and in Palestine tight now. He sent me a link to go to the Gates website the foundation and it is all on their, everyone of the bribes and it is global. Then what he did next has had me sick to my stomach all day. 2017 to 2018 he said google how many people were on earth he said be fair and start 3 to 4 years earlier and then go 3 years ahead so I did They alway had a rise of 3.2 to 3.9 million per here minus the death still the world grew about 1.6% in 2017 the population was i thing 7.6 million then i went to 2018 7.592 mil so he check a few other site and you can see it looked a little better but not the .3.9 mill missing that that this only happened one other time in prehistory the holocausts. He had screen shots and time stamps because google would go and change it the second it came out. so he posted to a site and then we copied it and posted it   and then Facebook kicked us both You see the got kicked for offering a platform that would teach the children how to protect themselves from online stalkers by code-sourcing and see who viewed your profile and his software called th troll alert would warn the parents and admin of the stalker and they could reach out to admin who would check the stalker and trace him to see if it was a danger or just some weird bypassing. Facebook should have loved it . But of course look where Facebook is now? Texas for trafficking children., From the very same post he reported for 2 years. He went there to meet with the attorneys and give them files that would prove that Facebook twitter all of them knew. It would have ended for Facebook. but the attorney were not there and would not contact him. He said the one ay to win or we are done. Join and build a platform for the people free r"

And here you have the essence of Facebook - their ""community guidelines"" are nothing more then censorship guidelines, where anyone not following official narratives is essentially lawless. Anything can be said against them and done against them.As soon as I find the time, am getting my pics off of the platform and it's sayonara Facebook.

Facebook,2021-10-06T23:51:47.000Z,1,They just banned me for saying a murderer should get what he did to his victims and then didnt even tell me and that was the only way my boss would talk to me then she thought i was ignoring her so she fired me. I have deleted fb but i had to go into my phone carriers store so they could cause the world thinks fb is all that. Well the truth is fb picks on mentally ill people like me making them feel bad for saying a guy killing his gf is wrong. Like what the hell kind of page is this? Also ive had a friend kill herself cause fb said she was misunderstanding people who were straight up bullying her so she felt like she was always wrong and killed herself thinking no one in this world cared. Shes right they dont. I might just follow her here soon and write a note saying it was all because of facebook. So a review about fb? They like you if your a bully murderer or rapist but hate you if your brain was made differently than others. Not my fault i havve 7 disorders. Yet i feel like it is my fault cause i get blamed for being bullied and then lose my job cause i said someone whose killed others should die. I have no words. Does anyone have the money to sue them for harassment?
Facebook,2021-10-06T18:58:59.000Z,1,"How can this site be allowed to operate? It is one of the most detrimental sites online. It creates and harbors lies, destroys reputations and relationships and worst of all tells its users what is and is not good for them. The Nazi regime was alot like this. Facebook almost cost me my job and has now cost me my wife. Addictive, abusive and completely pointless. Myself I will not use or download any app that is affiliated with Facebook or its partners. If more people would do this we could finally break free from the social media addictions and pull away from our phones, tablets and tvs. The world online isn't real. Facebook has ruined normal social interaction and created millions of shut ins and scammers. All to make one person rich. I know Facebook will be able to see this review but doubt there will be any response. Truly sad how one man has ruined an entire generation."

They are not for privacy at all!! I left from an near death abusive relationship and  tried to change the spelling of my name due to privacy issues but Facebook would not accept it not only do they don't accept you can't even explain why you need to do so. Tried opening a new account with again my name spelled differently now they blocked the account cause it's under review. And another thing that was aggravating and so disappointing was the fact that they encourage the terrorist acts of the gouvernements and even make and allow ads for their collective suicide poison. It's a vaccin, not iPhone publicity since when do we offer free gifts and lotteries to manipulate people in getting one. Disgusting."

Facebook,2021-10-03T19:23:25.000Z,1,"There's no such thing as free speech on Fascistbook anymore. They will censor anyone who doesn't go by their communist narrative. Not only they will censor your Facebook, but they will also even censor your messenger as well. 30 days ban on Facebook for what? 7 days ban on messenger for what? No other social media sites does this. Fascistbook also control what you can see and read on there. They do delete comments and filter the important truthful comments out. They also restrict what you can do on there even if you are not being banned. They will go even far as unliking your pages. Facebook allows those Karens, Kennys, snowflake boomers and trolls to go around bullying, harassing, name-calling, reporting comments and more but if you dare to stand up to defend yourself with a sensible comment then you are the “bully” violating their BS Community Standards, not them. Report them and it still doesn't go against the community standards even fake accounts and scammers doesn't violate anything. There are way too many advertisements, vaccine propaganda, false fact-checkers, misinformation, mainstream media fake news, bullies, trolls, fake accounts, scammers, hackers, pedophiles, bigots, racists, narcissists and more on there. There's no such thing as privacy on there either as all of your data is for sale to the highest bidder. Fascistbook will even delete your account without any reasons why the same way with violation of their community standards. They will not show you any proof of what you violated. There are no humans for their customer service either as they don't care about anyone except for the money selling people's data. Mark Zuckerberg needs to be sued for every penny that he got and then be thrown into prison for life for his crimes against humanity. Fascistbook needs to be shut down forever as it is nothing but a wreck to everyone’s mental health and abuse of their human rights and freedoms. If you want free speech then go to Telegram, MeWe, Gab, Minds, Rumble, Odysee and those likes. Delete Facebook forever and rot in hell Mark Zuckerberg!"

I was impressed by the pride he had in the company and their workmanship.Malcom kept me informed and was in constant contact with me through out the process and i found him to be true to his word. They also completed the roof with time to spare and my insurance was renewed. The folks that worked on my roof were courteous and concerned about my property and clean up.

Facebook,2021-09-08T12:12:55.000Z,1,"Continued executive distance, disinterest and greed for (any)traffic in recent years brings you the consequence of a social network that's all but a haven for scammers selling divorce/anatomic/vindictive etc *magic services by way of predatory, monetary fraud on all groups(vulnerable support, interest, hobby or professional) and pages.Unsecured cash loans traced back to apartments and individuals with private phone numbers and advertised domains, not sanctioned by most nations governments, a rise in now &gt;2 year old manned but fake accounts that spearhead all the previously mentioned scams with ample risk of malware. Individual moderators cannot keep up so as to guarantee a safe environment anymore. It was difficult in the past, it's impossible in the present.Censorship and vast numbers of questionable 7 day - 30 day bans can't help but ensure that legitimate users do not impede or otherwise flag the activity of the afore mentioned rampant racketeering. Said bans contribute to an Antisocial Network with isolation from friends and family on questionable grounds.The official route of repeated reports of extreme behavior returns with automated feedback and automated subsequent reviews also, stating that these do not go against community standards. Reports of abusive private messages in graphic language on Messenger do NOT get reviewed at all.Written objections regardless of language are branded as ""bullying"" with subsequent silencing. An architecture built on hounding obscure key words out of context shift the balance from the legitimate user base to approved, years old phishing accounts. Extremist political parties often unable to secure physical headquarters elsewhere have been shown to rally and be at home here for years, there is vile racism, xenophobic and inflammatory rhetoric, wide spread misinformation with demonstrated results and dangerous escalation in the society of several countries. Experience suggests that the algorithms do NOT work in practice, for filter or moderation as also suggested by many unsuccessful/minimally successful lawsuits in the past and the environment is one of general harassment, hostility, fearful expression on account of  silencing and shaming of the common man, in favor of violence, propaganda and endless abuse devoid of meritocracy or sensible restraint alike. Events and practices violate the right to *Protected Speech outlined in the constitution of several states, whereas *Unprotected Speech enjoys sympathy and protection by the algorithms, in the best case scenario. That *specific distinction appears to be overlooked on facebook in the official moderation architecture. Beyond that, it is hard to tell whether it extends further than unmanned mechanics."

Facebook,2021-09-04T13:03:21.000Z,1,"Mark Zuckerberg might be given unquestioning and countless opportunities by the media to espouse the virtues of facebook, being a platform for free speech. However it says more about the state of journalism then it does about the virtues of his empty words. Facebook is a dangerous and dicey platform for those who take it at face value,  it punishes free and critical speech when it comes to the short failing's,  of certain governments . It's nothing to do with fake news since Facebook has green lighted lots of fake news to dance around its pages , with respect to Covid denial. The more factual and accurate you are with your political blows the more likely your account will be terminated your whole hardware blocked from ever being herd from again.  The SNP are a case in point , a virtue  signaling  faux pseudo left leaning entity, who in reality are the opposite of what they  espouse along with their governing partners the Scottish Greens.  Flagging the double standards at play in the Scottish Parliament and corruption within the public sector of Scotland will not only get a profile erased it will also get all previous comments whipped regardless of their substance and being fact checked. So another face book lie is the one that purports to be a community of fair speech and fair play.  Horrible playground type insult's are permitted by the moderators who ever they might be ? but valid insightful comment's are flagged and erased in no time at all. So Nicola Sturgeon can have her woeful Covid management erased by the likes of influential moderators on one of the worlds biggest platforms and Zucker keeps good with a government who will no doubt reward him and his vile minions before selling off the country to the EU.  Facebook is a cancer on free speech , not a safe place for anyone who engages with it's content and full of tolerated scammers. Maybe we need to think back to how Zuck set up Facebook wasn't it trolling and hacking into Harvards systems that set the spark in motion ?? yet in no time this self serving , anti establishment figure has gone from a progressive to an establishment lackey. People need to start throwing facebook's system into flux's on  a daily basis hack undermine them ,  do what you can to bring this evil empire to it's knees and stop it interfering in the democracy of your own country."

So it's okay for the left to bully the right and nothing is ever done about it, but when the right has the audacity to say the current ""president "" needs to be impeached, im banned for 7 days.

I then found about 15 marketplace groups near me and sent them a request to join.  I try to create another Lego sale advert and out of no-where a message appears that my account is disabled. I click on the ""appeal"" option and uploaded a photo of me as per instructions. Two days later I see if my account is open only to find it is disabled permanently.  I did not use any offensive images or words, I did not contact anyone - except click a link to join my local marketplace groups.  Fb does not give any option to contact them, to find out why I am disabled or what I need to do in order to have my account re-activated.  It's no wonder I have never ever joined Fb for social posts.  I recommend Fb look into its service including customer service.  By Fb closing my account it made me feel discriminated.

Truths such as Ivermectin and HCQ genuinely defeat Covid!The 'faux' mRNA Covid vaccines are dangerous!Fascistbook censors the truth, spies on my internet activity and maybe even my private voice comms, as it puts up ads for the things we thought we were discussing in the privacy of our own home.I've no way to protect the FB sheeple, bans even added to currently running bans as they trawl through my past posts looking for other reasons to ban me, in their feeble attempt to prevent me getting my truths out there.On the contrary, FB seems to encourage the uninformed to go get euthanised, after being bombarded with a sea of CDC and Big pHARMa sponsored bs.I've moved to Pocketnet where there's no adds and more importantly, the uncensored truth flourishes, not to mention I get paid crypto to use it!"

I wish everyone would remove their accounts but that's unrealistic. Maybe then Zuckerbutt would make serious changes, after all, WE are making him billions! The censorship has gotten out of hand as well as the gazillion ads. Why stay on a social platform when you can't actually be social? It is ridiculous and not worth the effort to try.

Facebook,2021-08-03T14:06:08.000Z,1,"I have been on facebook for 10 years. I am an artist. over the years they have become more and more of an obstacle. In the beginning, I create embattled archetypes that represents issues facing us today and comment on the human condition.  I did a series of masked women in lingerie and military uniforms. I write alot about why I do the type of art I do.  They gave me a hard time about this. These paintings were done in Oaxaca and got into the Cervantino art Festival, the most prestigous art festival in Mexico by famous curators and shown at the Museo de Alhondigas in Guanajuato. I put up ads and they refuse them and have taken my money on some occassions. I have complained. They don't return my money. They have become an obstacle in my ability to make money and be seen. I live in a small town, so it matters that I have internet presence and its what helps drive traffic for sales and my survival.   They are unsupportive of the small business and especially artists. I know alot of artists that are leaving facebook because of constant censorship. I have followed their guidelines and they still censor me. Now I can't log in on my computer if I restart my computer. Even though I have the correct email and password. Now I have to have it texted to my phone and because my phone wasn't working I have to go thru a process to identifying myself, which I did in which they told me it could take up to 48 hours and still nothing. I do make sales on facebook, I get messages and when I am unable to answer right away I loose sales. Therefore, if you are an artist who does cute animals and flowers, you will do good on facebook, because they only know commercial art, but not the that type of art that has meaning.  But if you do art that is edgy, has meaning, comments on the human condition and inspires people you will be censored. I am leaving facebook. I will go to instagram and google. That is the advice I am giving to any artist that has any imagination and likes edgy topics. The big tech places like facebook don't want you! They are ignorant and want bland jello style art that says nothing. Isis Rodriguez"

Also they limit your profile finding so no one sees or find you, even what you post or comment, same thing they will do to your business page, want to be found pay huge money for ads. My advice go create your own website and remove any social Icons and stop worshipingh this ocult company.Facebook is like Pacman and the dots it eats are websites and small businesses, which by this make it bigger and richer.Stop using FB gain your freedom with your own web, stop feeding the corporations which want to rule not only the physical world but also the digital Internet."

Facebook,2021-07-25T16:58:04.000Z,1,"I've had my Facebook account for 14 years and until this past year I've never had my account restricted as I don't ever post anything that violates the community standards on the app. I recieved my first restriction this year, which was a misunderstanding and taken out of context, I disputed and even though Facebook agreed with my dispute.. my account remained restricted for 2 weeks and I had a mark against my account. This continued to happen with posts that were completely normal and I'm struggling to understand how they are being flagged for misconduct. After a recent 30 day restriction, I was only unrestricted for less then 24 hours when my account was restricted again for a post that was just me writing a cocktail recipe. There was a swear word in the post (for a joke) but I was still banned again for ""bullying and harassment"". I wouldn't be so bothered that I no longer have the ability to use my account, if I hadn't just spent an entire year completely isolated because of covid. I feel so lonely and disconnected from the world that I've become depressed and I'm struggling deeply with some dark thoughts because of it. My support groups are also on Facebook, which of course I don't have access too. I can't interact with events or posts about gatherings at all and for absolutely no reason Facebook has further isolated me and forced me to be completely alone. I don't have other forms of social media. I also have a new phone number that nobody knows yet. I'm struggling with some social anxiety, so using messenger to contact each person individually isn't something I can do. I tried reporting the issue to Facebook which did nothing. When I tried to make a report again.. I was given a notification saying that the report option was turned off for my account. I can't make a new facebook because it recognizes my ip address and the new account is immediately restricted as well. I have mental health issues and physical health issues that make getting myself out into the world a bit difficult. This is careless and disrespectful on facebooks part. I feel like I've lost the ability to contact anyone and when I think about the fact that (for at least) the next 30 days I won't have the ability to speak to another person... its almost hard to breath. And even after that.. I feel like I'll just br immediately restricted again because it keeps happening. This might not seem like a big deal to a normal person who doesn't have some of the hurdles and issues that others do... but to people like me? This is basically a death sentence. I don't know what to do if I'm not allowed to talk to anyone at all anymore. I can't keep doing this. I just want to give up, what's the point if I'm completely alone."

They refuse to refund my money.Up until yesterday (24.07.2021) she/they still had ads on Facebook.  I notified them and my bank and still can't get a refund, infuriating because  someone knows which account my money was paid to''MORE WILL FOLLOW... until Facebook will close Karen May and similar scammers and takes a proper care of Marketplace business.... or maybe Facebook just will close my Facebook account, to shut me up!Will see.At the moment Im reporting this Online to Cyber Fraud Police.UPDATE 02.08.2021Nearly a Month passed since I purchased Vase from the scammer Karen May / Parker / Jones on the facebook.PayPal refused to issue refund and facebook deleted my Listing from the Marketplace regarding Scammer but the funniest thing:SCAMMER STILL SELLING ON MARKETPLACE ON THE SAME KAREN MAY ACCOUNT!?I received many emails from cheated buyers, but Karen still stealing buyers money, and facebook dont move a finger!So today I opened case against PayPal on Resolver website, and it went to Financial Ombudsman.Next, more serious steps I will take against facebook until Karen may will be gone or jailed.(if you noticed, Im not calling facebook by ''Facebook'' anymore as I think, the company like this, does not disserve to be appreciated and called from the Capital Letter!)Speak 2U later."

Facebooks actions say they support us being scammed as the scammers pay them for ad space .I am going do delete my account as they are 1sided and never help their customers this makes my 4th time being banned for standing up for myself and nothing being done to the other parties involved.the only time I have found that they deleted a scam is when a news agency catches them.Facebook is no better than the scum they allow to keep stealing from is people.Its been 3 days since I first reached out to Facebook still no messages and the will never answer either because this is not the first time I have tried contacting them They do not care .I will be going through my facebook page and removing all my pictures and shutting my account down because they have not responded to anything I have said on their support page or here either .It is sad they choose to support scammers over the people.

Facebook,2021-07-19T05:51:13.000Z,1,What makes me more mad than anything is that posts from years ago are just now being censored for no reason what so ever especially on Instagram. Being so sensitive over everything has gotten way out of hand and plus fact checkers aren’t even doing their job and makes everything political. If it was something about a republican it is automatically claimed false by fact checkers but if it was a Democrat that was posted everything is apparently “true”. Maybe think more about some Democrat telling someone to kill theirselves instead of censoring a song that has been up for a year or two.

Snapchat refused to sell to them, so they introduced filters into their apps out of spite. To try and topple TikTok they've copied them too - introducing Reels into Instagram. They are able to use their massive user base within Instagram and Facebook to monopolize new products and ensure they're successful.I'd love to see FB crash and burn."

Facebook,2021-07-18T08:08:48.000Z,1,"I have been advertising with Facebook for over 3 years. The other day i went and created a new ad for an upcoming event i had coming up. I published the ad and it went into review.The next thing i knew, i had a message telling me my ad account was disabled and i was banned from running ads. I got no feedback, no reasons and they even disabled my other ads which were already approved and running for years.I sent an appeal as i had no idea what I had done wrong, i then got a message straight away saying they have enabled my account, but yet again no reasons, feedback as to what i did wrong.I was too scared to turn my new ad on, in fear of being disabled again, so i sent another message asking them what i did wrong? So i could prevent this from happening again...this is the message i received in return:"" I've had another look at your ad account and unfortunately, we won't be able to re-enable it. There's no further action that you may take here. Please consider this decision as final ""What is wrong with these people? It makes no sense. I went back into my ad account and thankfully its still enabled and its not been disabled despite the message i received.As a regular monthly advertiser who invests money in facebook, I have been left stressed, confused, scared with no idea what is going on. And I'm too scared to even run another ad again in the fear i may get disabled. I have no reasons, no feedback, no idea what the problem was in the first place.This is how they treat people who invest in them, like total crap off the bottom of their shoe.

Last year I posted something about the libertarian presidential candidate on a post by the NRA about Biden or Trump. Someone commented on it something that was misinformed and no more than name calling based on my beliefs being different from theirs. My response was ""You are a moron. Do some research."" Apparently it is okay for someone to post something completely false but telling them they are not as smart as they think they are and to read things for themselves is bullying. I may have said it in a crass way but that is completely ridiculous. Please tell me how I was the bully in this situation? I'm waiting.. They act like they crack down on misinformation, when really they fuel it. On top of that I definitely don't trust them enough to have the app downloaded on my phone. Creepy ads. Y'all know."

But I live in a country where I could, but I don't believe it's socially acceptable. But when I'm talking about a person who has committed crimes against the British nation, as in suggesting and planning an illegal break away to re-join the EU, I get annoyed, and I get annoyed to the point of speaking my mind, which because I live in a country where freedom of speech exists and is part and parcel of our laws ... I have to ask the question, who gives you the right to control how people voice their thoughts?? And more to the point, I was not planning a coo, or putting together an assassination, I was merely doing what I have a right to do in my country!

Facebook,2021-06-25T17:38:02.000Z,1,"First of all, I do not lean politically much to the left or right, and this is not about my own content getting censored (I don’t post much). But for YEARS I have been noticing that FB does not take down OBVIOUSLY fake profiles, and they are selective/inconsistent about which posts (containing obvious hate speech/threats/harassment etc.) they remove. Nonetheless, I secretly continued reporting these things and had pretty good success getting them removed.Again, I’m not reporting stuff I just don’t like. I’m talking about profiles that have no content or 1 picture posted within the last few hours, with fake names like “Iamso Overit” or “Faq Hughbich” etc. or profiles that literally post Russian propaganda every 10 seconds or swarm “laugh” reacts on news articles about death, etc. Facebook has now BLOCKED MY ABILITY TO REPORT ABUSE. After about 30 minutes of doing this and taking several profiles down today, suddenly the report abuse buttons just ‘don’t work.’ Everything else does, though.At this point FB is becoming a serious liability and safety threat to users. It’s not even about their inconsistent approach to moderation, they are literally stripping users of the ability to report someone abusing them or others. I plan on writing a scathing rebuke of this corrupt company and posting it publicly. I am urging my friends and family to strongly reconsider whether this corrupt institution is worth their time, or even SAFE TO USE anymore."

I have no way of getting my old account back because they changed the email and phone number on the account so I have no access and Facebook won’t take the report seriously and won’t shut the page down for good!

I've submitted multiple forms of ID and just get automated response that they cant verify me because my info doesnt match the account. Of course it doesnt match because someone changed it.  And for what?  I have nithing more than most.  Beyond frustrated and devastated that there isnt a way of getting assistance for this. Simply a ""hacked account customer service"" phone line would have plenty of business to warrant paying employees to actually help us.

And still been permanently restricted still. I even wrote them 20 times within the last month to fix this problem and they never wrote back. I never posted and said anything offensive. And tried to advertise anything offensive or inappropriate. All I’ve ever done was try to buy ads for my sunglasses company. And this is the thanks I get!!

Going through all their steps trying to recover it because i have a BUSINESS PAGE, an online website connected with my personal profile nothing helps because they end up giving me as final option to send a code to the person who hacked my account. Facebook you should be sue by everyone who had theier account hacked as tou support criminal activities.

Facebook,2021-06-16T06:46:47.000Z,3,So this is where Trustpilot fails. Clearly the Trump supporter club has been attacking the platform with reviews here. Every single reviewer has been blocked for bulllying and harrasment. Having said that I myself got a warning for saying Brits are dumb for not getting rid if BoJo when I myself am a Brit. So yes they are overdoing it but protecting conservatives and far right politicians a lot more than normal people it seems.On the buisness side they ask that you use your personal account for work and have no GDPR policy. They must be lobbying and paying said politicians a lot not to be fined milions by ICO.And finally The Marketplace although offering quicker sales than EBay is a bit of a cess pit. Lots of people trying to bully you into lowering prices. Tons of groups just there to mock posts and bully. So one has to be really careful who you give your mobile and address to. It is simply dangerous.

Facebook,2021-06-13T07:29:47.000Z,1,Facebook is awful and deliberately targets posts that are against their sponsors. They target those that support Palestine (their support base is HUGE) and give greater coverage to those that support Israel (and their support base is very SMALL). Need to find a new social media platform.

Yes, I am responsible for the tweets, but I was unaware that they needed to be sent privately at the time, and I was quite busy with work. I've written to them several times, demanding that they remove a few photos and phrases that are both unethical and embarrassing to my family and myself on some groups i have seen on facebook but all to no avail. Facebook is useless to me, despite the fact that I have made efforts to reach them and lay a complaint, however, discovered a team on their website  alienmanhackers xyz and emailed them at alienmanh4cck At proton mail com .

The odd thing is that not only do they have videos called ""Shoot em up"", but there is a actual profile titled ""Shoot em"". Facebook has now violated a law. I guess we will have to see how the civil law looks upon discrimination and other violations of the law.

However, Facebook does not allow genuine, honest and sincere comments to be posted. Instead, they ban users for hate speech and take them in custody for 30 days most of the times, which makes no sense as they have a rule named ""community standards"", but the employees dishonour their censorship and base their judgements on political stances. Beware of posting any words that object to Mainland China since I've been prohibited from telling the truth on Facebook several times, guys. Thirty days means a lot."

Facebook options to correct this problem do not work and I am forced to self-delete my account.When Facebook uses the term community standards the specter of oxymoronic logic blocks out the light of reality.    The weirdness started with my being accused by their censors of not meeting Facebook community standards. If posting factual quotes by Rush Limbaugh and Donald Trump are breaking their community standards how are people supposed to remember what they've said and done. (Is this a ""huge coverup?"")    Another time I was suspended for Covid miss information. That's simply not true. I have had both the vaccine doses and I have supported masks and social distancing before they were even implemented by any agency. I never have figured out what they were talking about.   NOW I HAVE HUNDREDS OF POSTS ON MY ACTIVITY LOG THAT I DIDN'T CREATE. I changed the password several times and followed the processes the website provided but the fake posts kept happening. 91 fake posts showed up over a 24 hour period while my account was deactivated.   Multiple requests for attention and help have been ignored. I have been clear in my communications, repeating multiple times, that I do not feel safe when someone else is posting on my timeline. I have no idea what they're saying under my name.   The problem here is not that things happen, but that they refuse to recieve information about or correct the problem. Their corporate phone and website solutions lead nowhere. Phone prompts eventually lead you to someone who tells you that they're not helping anyone over the phone. The website processes do not solve the problem and only lead you back to do them again.    I have lodged a complaint with the BBB. I don't expect much from this because they have a record of just ignoring complaints. THAT SUGGESTS TO ME A DEEP LEVEL OF CONTEMPT FOR THEIR CLIENTS.  So, my account is being self-deleted, and I have been silenced. Good job Mark Zuckerberg. You managed to shut down a voice that has tried to keep some truth at the center of the viewfinder."

Facebook,2021-05-29T18:59:23.000Z,1,"It is that I have to give a star before I can write something down. When I was given the choise by Trustpilot to write something down without given fb a star I would. In fact, fb get no stars from me. If people post something that is true and even proven to be true, fb takes it off telling that the post is fake news and a danger to the world. Fb is trying more and more to hide true things and when some one posts something that fb does not like to be shown then they punnish the person who posted something for a minimum of 30 days in fb prison. 30 Days restricted by Fb, without the opportunity to give a reaction to them about their action. Even if it is a broadcast from a local news organization fb has the guts to take it off writing that they broadcasted fake news. So, something is very wrong with that Mark Zuckerberg and something is definitly wrong with all those checkers he hired. And even when people put a red heart on their time line with the text: I have a heart fom freedom, fb blocks it and takes it of. So if Trustpilot gives me the opportunety to give fb zero stars then I would give fb zero stars, which means that fb does not earn a star at all. You have to earn a star showing good behaviour and fb does only show bad behaviour. Some people have the thought that fb looks more and more like a criminal organization and I agree with that. I even think that Trustpilot gives a wrong impression to the world. Why? Because we have to give Fb at least one star, even if we don't want to give them a star. So to Trustpilot I like it better when I have the opportunity to choose my self weather I give a star or not to a company, because now Trustpilot forces me to give Fb one star and I don't want to because one star for Fb is on star to many. And Trustpilot gives the choices to show my writing to fb, but that is not such a good idea. What you think fb does when some one gives them a bad review? Then this person goes to fb jail immediatly. So fb is going the wrong way. And on which side does Trustpilot stay? On the side of the people or on the side of Fb???"

Their algorithms are very unfair and they spy to much on people.  They ban people and don't tolerate others views that disagree with they're own"

To get any information about what’s really happening in the world, I like many others need to rely on other sources. I only stay connected because of market place.
